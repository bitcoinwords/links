  Andre Cronje and the Philosophy of Yearn Finance



<p>This week, I &#8211; Hasu &#8211; talk to Andre Cronje, a long-time DeFi developer, and creator of Yearn Finance. You can think of Yearn as a smart bank account that automatically allocates your assets to different low-risk investment strategies that execute on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>My co-host is Tarun Chitra, the CEO and founder of Gauntlet, a company that helps stress test the incentive structures and economics of cryptocurrency protocols, especially of DeFi protocols.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re releasing this interview in two parts. The first gives you an introduction to Yearn Finance, it&#8217;s future, and Andre&#8217;s design and investment philosophy in building it. Part II explores the design space for governance systems in DeFi &#8211; one of the hottest topics in crypto right now.</p>



<p>Listen and subcribe here</p>



<p>Hasu (00:00:00):<br>Welcome to Uncommon Core, where we explore the big ideas in crypto from first principles. This week, my regular co-host Su Zhu is taking a break and I’m instead joined by Tarun Chitra of Gauntlet. Tarun, welcome to the show! Can you introduce yourself to our audience?</p>



<p>Tarun Chitra (00:00:17):<br>Hey, yeah, thanks for having me. I&#8217;m Tarun Chitra, I&#8217;m the CEO and founder of Gauntlet, a company that helps stress test, the incentive structures and economics of cryptocurrency protocols, especially defi protocols. But my background is in both high-frequency trading and sort of low-level hardware design. And so I&#8217;ve kind of spread myself across a bunch of different fields and there&#8217;s nothing quite like the current state of defi and crypto to, to make people have to use brain cells that they didn&#8217;t have to use before, so I&#8217;m really excited to be in this world.</p>



<p>Hasu (00:01:01):<br>together, we are excited to talk to Andre Cronje, a long-time DeFi developer and creator of Yearn finance, which you can think of as a smart bank account that automatically allocates your assets to different low-risk investment strategies that execute on the Ethereum blockchain. Thanks for joining us, Andre! Can you tell us a bit about your background?</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:01:07):<br>Yeah, sure. Definitely definitely much less of a pedigree. Really just a dev. I don&#8217;t even consider myself a particularly good one. I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m an integrator, I like putting pieces together and then seeing what comes out. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a very exciting space for me right now to be playing in defi. Money Legos is one of the coolest toys that has come up in a very long time. So yeah, I&#8217;ve just been focusing on this the last few years. It&#8217;s been a nice natural evolution from my previous FinTech background. So it&#8217;s I echo Tarun&#8217;s statements. It&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a very exciting and challenging space to be in right now. And I, I think it&#8217;s also very exploratory which I think is going to lead to a lot more new and exciting things as well.</p>



<p>Hasu (00:02:05):<br>Yeah. Thank you. I think we can also be happy to have you in this space. I think that you&#8217;re in is one of the most interesting projects right now, which is how we met right. When I wrote an article, I was researching for an article on the governance in Yearn.finance last week. So can you describe in your own words, what Yearn is?</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:02:29):<br>Well, OK, so, so I guess Yearn as sort of an umbrella statement is, is anything I build, whatever I build I throw under Yearn. The original V1 Yearn specifically was a, a lending pool optimizer, I guess, aggregator, I don&#8217;t know what you want to call it. So, so very very simplistically. There were a lot of vendors out there. We had Aave, we had DYDX. We had Compound, we had Nuo, Fulcrum. There was a lot and I spent a lot of time normalizing each one&#8217;s interest rates, how they are reporting it on chain and, and what the net result of their number is because each one has a little, little different nuance in how they do it. And the reason I did that was so that I could figure out where&#8217;s the best place to park my money at any given point in time for the highest aggregate interest rate.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:03:26):<br>And I realized that these rates fluctuate so much between all of these different pools, because there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s still a lot of capital inefficiencies in our markets. So I spent a lot of time moving these funds around and I started looking at a automated way to do that. And then I came up with the original Yearn, which very simplistically you throw your funds in it. As soon as you interact with the contract, it looks at the different APR rates between the different lenders and then it simply moves the funds there. So it ended up in aggregate getting better yield than any one lender. And because it&#8217;s now a pooled solution, it meant that there was a lot more interaction with the contract, which also increased the granularity of when it switches for different interest rates. And it also sort of subsidized gas because you know, now it&#8217;s not 20 people, each paying gas to change.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:04:19):<br>It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s one interaction that moves it then as the next one comes in and the APR is still the highest at where it is that it just stays there. I&#8217;d say that was the very, very first iteration. And that later on became the premise for what I then called the V2. My versioning sucks. So I need to change naming standards, but the V2, which became the baseline for the Y pool, which is the yCRV pool which we ended up building on top of that because the concept was why not have profits switching and trading fees. So that was just a nice way to get a little bit higher APR. And at that time, that was pretty much the best rates you could get because you had the optimized lending and now you have the trading fees on top. We had to make some sacrifices for the V2 pool.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:05:04):<br>Cause the problem is for, for the trades to be efficient, you couldn&#8217;t rebalance the underlying assets the whole time because it would make gas too expensive. So the V2 yearn version has a has a no rebalance withdrawal deposit, which just makes your swaps much cheaper. And then it has a full rebalance, which is when you directly interact. So, so there was some trade offs there after that one was the sUSD pool, which was awesome because Synthetix were kind enough to add liquidity incentives on top and they allowed you to, to stake. The LP token you got out of the issue is the Y pool meta pool into their, their MTA, their reward system. And, and that&#8217;s when I started playing with their rewards contracts. Which, which now, you know, is the basis of YFI. YFII YYFI, YAM, I add to the list.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:05:59):<br>So amazing respect there for, for Anton, from 1inch and Kain of Synthetix the work that I did there. And then the market was kind of quiet for a long time. So I started playing with a bunch of other tools I was interested in. I started looking into, into synthetic assets. So I started looking into some stable coin stuff started doing the ySwap stuff, but, but the main area I was focusing on was, was yLeverage and yTrade, which was all about leveraged stable coin positions. Cause I wanted to, I wanted to promote trading on the Y pool for curve cause the more trading on that pool, the higher the fees, the better the incentives for the LPs and the higher, the overall APR. So I started holding things like yLeverage, which is flash loan from DYDX into maker.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:06:48):<br>USDC mints DAI sells the DAI to USDC repays the debt on that side gives you the profit and you decide when you want to close your vault, it hands over the vault, back to you. So, so it&#8217;s up to the user and yTrade was a little bit more of an LP system. So you, you provide your curve LP tokens, which gives you access to the underlying Dai USDC USDT or TUSD. And then that allows you to open a trader position and trade it on top of that. And then COMP came along and that changed quite a lot because now all of a sudden, I, it, it wasn&#8217;t as simple as aggregating on chain information and knowing where the best APR is. And, and, and that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s still the purpose of the yearn system overall is to maximize APR for its LPs. And now you had the situation where, where being a lending provider and compound was the better result because of the added APR on top of the compound token, but you don&#8217;t exactly have a lot of on chain oracles.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:07:51):<br>And the ones that are, you know, are, are, were fairly easily, abusable still at that time. So I started looking at a, a more, a more like almost token sets, you know, social trading idea behind yield farming, social yield farming, I guess. And I started playing with the concept of creating a sort of collective and how that works of, of yield farmers that are also interested in this stuff. So, you know, as a collective, they&#8217;re a lot faster at identifying strategies. There are a lot faster at, at ranking strategies in terms of their performance. And it&#8217;s a lot faster to, to be able to allocate to the pool, the resources. So, so that&#8217;s sort of where the, the idea of the, the YFI token, the YFI token first came out because it was just for people that are in these things. I built a, which I assume are yield farmers themselves, which, you know, back then that wasn&#8217;t the terminology.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:08:51):<br>It was just an LP, but anyway so it makes sense that they are yield farmers as well. So these are the people I want to have tokens because these are the people that collectively can make these decisions and keep hunting these opportunities. Because the other thing that was important to me is that if a new strategy came along, it could be added in a short enough time span that it could be maximized, but not so fast as to be able to create a risk area there. And I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s something that Hasu has mentioned in his articles as well, which I think is very important for people to know, because, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a tradeoff between how quickly you move and how securely but we can unpack that a little bit later. So, so token came about, that&#8217;s why I said, it&#8217;s not going to be a sale.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:09:38):<br>You know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s no financial value to it. It&#8217;s purely as a collective decision making tool for the system. At that time I started looking at the COMP governance solution, which, which I, I do think is fantastic, but I do find it a little bit rigid and I didn&#8217;t at that time yet know what the solution was going to look like. So I, I, I know where my, my skills and abilities fall short. One thing is definitely in terms of you know, proper, proper governance control mechanisms and economics and any of that stuff. So I decided, you know, let&#8217;s leave this to the people that are going to have the token in their hands. Their collective intelligence is better than mine in this area. So I had opted for that. Let the best minds in this industry have a interest in it and then give their opinion on it while I stick to, you know, building out the coding and sticking to those things.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:10:34):<br>And I think that part has been, has been fairly successful. Cause we definitely have some phenomenal minds currently working on some of these solutions, which they&#8217;re coming up with stuff. I definitely wouldn&#8217;t have dreamed of while, while I, you know, can just stick on sort of the strategy side building out everything and then eventually I ended up with the, with the now V2,yVaults and their ideas to be a yield farming tool. So, so unlike, unlike the V1 Yearn and yPools, which, which are, are static and immutable and you can&#8217;t mess with them and I love them.</p>



<p>Speaker 3 (00:11:09):<br>I needed a new solution that can upgrade and that can pivot within, within certain rules and restrictions. So, so that&#8217;s why I came up with, you know, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s let governance vote in strategies, and then you have strategists that are capable of switching between different strategies and things like that. So, so there&#8217;s a whole role ecosystem that I still need to unpack and share that whole design philosophy, but that&#8217;s really how we got to Yearn. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s been a lot of mutating because of how the industry itself has been changing and just trying to remain adaptable to that because, because what, what we have now in terms of, of LP profit is very different than what we, you know December Jan beginning of this year. So, so the landscape has changed so much that the solutions have needed to change. And, and that&#8217;s pretty much where we&#8217;re currently at.</p>



<p>Hasu (00:12:08):<br>Yeah, thanks for this. A very comprehensive overview. So as I said, there are now three yield farming primitives in, in Yearn, which is the first one is the yTokens, the first iteration. And then you have vaults that are paired with strategies, and then you have delegated vaults. So could you please describe, or like summarize very briefly again, the difference between them and why should I use which iteration,</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:12:36):<br>So, so the, the yTokens themselves they&#8217;re there to keep things simple, you know, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, you, you don&#8217;t want, you don&#8217;t want exposure to, to yield farming or any of those strategies. You don&#8217;t want someone that&#8217;s going to be moving your money around without you knowing you want something that&#8217;s static and playing. They are, they are only measured in their assets. So DAI has yDAI USDT has yUSDT All the way through to sUSD simplistically, you put in the asset, it gets automated, lent out to different lenders. You get interest rates from there and, and the end. So, so it&#8217;s a very, it&#8217;s a very clean, closed loop solution of the lot it has other than, of course the standard composability of risk and the underlying system risks, which are still high risks.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:13:26):<br>It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s the safest of the lot, but using it, you&#8217;re going to be looking at, at, you know, a band of about between five to 15% IPR, which, which I still think on a stable coin is phenomenal because you&#8217;re not going to get those rates at your bank in any case. On top of that, if you want a little bit more exposure, but then you, you do take away the native underlying assets. You can also deposit your outputs there into the curve y pool or the BUSD pool or the sUSD pool. And then you get the trading fees as well. But for example, the pool balances underneath can shift. So if you put in, let&#8217;s say 10 million DAI three months ago in, in curve and you, you can&#8217;t withdraw 10 million DAI now, cause there&#8217;s only 6 million DAI in there, but you can still have, you know, the 3 million DAI and then 7 million USD.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:14:19):<br>So, so you do lose the strict association of the underlying assets, but you do get those trading fees on top, which is still good. And, you know, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s yielding you upwards of 10 to 20%, depending on the time span you&#8217;re looking at in aggregate sense, since inception about 11%. And now I&#8217;m not talking about additional incentives, you know, like, like the curve you can get from, from being an LP on SNX, you can get from staking the sUSD LP output token or those kinds of things, or those are additional benefits over and above. And then the vaults are definitely the higher risk ones because the money moves. And, and even though, even though you might be comfortable with the strategies it currently has, you might not be comfortable with the strategy. It has two weeks from now. So, so, so there&#8217;s a little bit more involvement and definitely more risk because the YFI community as a whole gets to the point where, where they control what the strategies are and they control when it moves.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:15:23):<br>But it automates these processes for you. So, so its job is if the current best farm is farming DAI leveraged into comp, and that&#8217;s going to be the strategy for DAI and you provide your DAI, it&#8217;s going to do that strategy, but should that change to now DAI into Y pool for curve tokens and a new strategy is deployed, voted in and then switched to that one. So, so, so because it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s let&#8217;s call it upgradable you know, even though by, by, by contract definition, it&#8217;s not upgradable proxies, but, but you know, I can, we can add a new strategy and then switch to that strategy. So, so let&#8217;s consider that an upgrade, even though the vaults are not, the vaults are static themselves. That definitely adds an additional layer of risk. And that is the risk reward adjustment that you see.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:16:11):<br>I mean, the vaults are performing a lot higher, but it definitely comes with more risk than the original V1s. And then things like yTrade and ySwap? They&#8217;re, they&#8217;re still in my R and D finalization phase, so I&#8217;m not really trying to promote them yet, except for people that want to experiment a little bit. But I still have a lot more iterations to do on those before, before I&#8217;m happy with, with doing proper public releases on them. So yeah, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really based on your risk appetite at the, at the one far end of the spectrum, you have the sitting on a lot of, you know, USDT USDC, whatever capital and it&#8217;s currently sitting idle and they don&#8217;t wanna, they don&#8217;t want to expose it to risk, but, but they also don&#8217;t just want to have it sitting idle.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:16:56):<br>So for them the original, yPools into curve, great choice nice and stable it&#8217;s performed well in the past. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s where I would park it or for the people that know about it, yield farming and, you know, know what&#8217;s going on a good place to go is the vaults. So I do recommend having, having a little bit of awareness. But another reason why you want to go to the vaults is because it&#8217;s it in quotes, subsidizes gas. So it&#8217;s because again, it&#8217;s this pooled solution. So it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s not everyone paying for gas the whole time, but a single interaction that, that triggers the chain that then pays for the gas, a unlucky gas lottery, I guess is another good reason to say sitting there. And then, but I mean, at the far end of the spectrum, you&#8217;ve got the, you&#8217;ve got the, you&#8217;ve got the defi guy that he&#8217;s on CT, crypto Twitter, you knows what&#8217;s going on there.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:17:54):<br>He&#8217;s in telegram, he&#8217;s a discord. He knows what the strategies are. And he probably manages this to himself for the most part. But maybe he just wants to save on gas as well. So then a good reason to go into the vault strategy. I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve had a few people that I&#8217;ve spoken to that just want to take the weekend off. And then, you know, they, they don&#8217;t want to be jacked in the whole time. So when they want to take the weekend off, they park the funds in there, so they don&#8217;t have to worry about it. But if you&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re that, that complete end of the spectrum person that knows what&#8217;s going on is updated, then I still recommend you manage your money yourself. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s still the, the, the, my money, my responsibility peak area, but, you know, everyone can&#8217;t have all of the information all the time, especially not with how quickly things are currently changing.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:18:42):<br>I, I do think it&#8217;ll, it&#8217;ll subside and we&#8217;ll go back to, to something a little bit more normalized where, you know, it doesn&#8217;t change every eight hours, but instead changes, you know, once a month. And that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d like to see it as well, because I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a big, I&#8217;m a big advocate for sustainable yields. And right now we&#8217;re in a very unsustainable space, which, which causes me a little bit of concern a lot of concern, but, but, you know, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s part of the cycle we&#8217;re going through. So, so, so that&#8217;s fine. So, so I guess I&#8217;d say those are sort of, you&#8217;re different, you&#8217;re different benefits and the risks that comes with it. I mean, personally, I still sit more on the, on the Yearn V1 side. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not as volatile or I just want to outperform what I can do in my, in my local currency savings account that I&#8217;m happy. It doesn&#8217;t have to be,</p>



<p>Hasu (00:19:40):<br>When you say you sit more on the V1 side, you mean with your own money because you also use Yearn to invest your own money, right?</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:19:48):<br>Yeah. So, so, so the majority of sitting in there, which I consider to be the safest area, and then what I&#8217;m willing to risk, I play in the vaults, or I play as an LP because there, I know there&#8217;s more risks. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s fun playing there, but, but I still prefer sustainability. Sustainable APR is a, is a very important thing that we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re currently losing sight of a little bit, but hopefully we&#8217;ll get back there. And obviously as, as market and capital inefficiencies improve as well, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll also see that line flatten out to, to where it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s technically supposed to be comparative to the rest of the world&#8217;s interest rate minus fees from banking, et cetera.</p>



<p>Tarun Chitra (00:20:34):<br>So what one natural kind of next question related to this is, you know, how, how complex do you think these strategies are going to get? And especially in terms of, you know, reallocation to different yield farming really at venues. I, you know, I think maybe when Yearn V1 came out, it was much more clear that sort of the Yearn or InstaDapp type of strategy of, or the, what, you know, yToken one strategy of optimizing dollar denominated or stable kind dollar denominated APR is, is kind of like a good user experience. But now that you have the whole system for, for really starting to explore a bigger strategy space, you know, how complex do you think things will get? You know, I think, you know, we know that there&#8217;s this economy of scale to having gas costs shared across the pool. So that means you have more gas and implicitly to spend on strategies. And then, so maybe walk us through your thought process of that, but you&#8217;ve kind of seen in the community. Do you think complexity will dominate, or do you think people will stick with simple strategies? Would they be sort of directional strategies trying to chase momentum or will they be trying to be more like market neutral?</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:21:58):<br>So, so from, from my perspective the things I write, I like to keep very simple strategies, you know, do do one small thing and don&#8217;t do too much. But, but that just because that suits my specific development style the more complex, the more risk. So, so from, from, from the, what strategies will I keep writing fairly basic. I don&#8217;t like I don&#8217;t like too many protocols working together at the same time. As that increases your amount of failures from the strategies I&#8217;ve been discussing with people that I think are phenomenal, they, they get super complex. So, so what I mean by that is, is as we&#8217;re seeing more of, you know, a options market developing and a perpetual market and a leverage market, then you, you, you can start adding in these different hedging strategies and you can, you can go to Synthetix and you can, you can mention then take that into a pool and then hedge that against, you know, something that maybe you take out on UMA.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:22:58):<br>So, so I think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly possible to do increasingly complex. I think the more complex, the strategy, the different vetting process that would need to go through, but, but, but definitely from, from what I&#8217;ve, from what I&#8217;ve spoken to a lot of. And I mean, I, I think it has a lot to do with, with, with who&#8217;s building the strategy as well. Cause like the, the, when, when I speak to guys like the framework guys, you know, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re very much into, into these, these hedged yielding strategies will where they might fund a perp and then hedge that on the other side. And like, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s very good yield, but, but I&#8217;m not from that world. So it&#8217;s very difficult for me to quantify. Because one of my, one of my code rules is still, I just, I just codify what I do as a human.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:23:58):<br>So, you know, if I, if I, as a human can go deposit and then see the APR and withdrawal and then maybe get an output token and sell that for the underlying asset, and then that&#8217;s something I can codify. I&#8217;m happy with that strategy. But yeah, I mean, at, at the, at the baseline, you know, a strategy as, as simplistic as, as put DAI into compound and you get interest and that&#8217;s a good strategy, but at a layer on top of that, now you have add DAI into compound and farm COMP. And now you have at DAI into farm COMP sell COMP to DAI. And now you can take it a step further and you can go DAi, folded, leverage, whatever you want to call it, you know, four times and then farm and sell COMP. So, so again, risk reward versus complexities slash APR.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:24:46):<br>I, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t, as I currently discuss this, know what that mix is going to be, but, but if it goes the way I&#8217;d like it to go, then, then I think it&#8217;s going to become increasingly complex to, to maximize those market inefficiencies and capital inefficiencies until it gets on until, until the strategies themselves flatten out, you know, that, that line to the point where it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s aggregate in the market and to do that, you do need to mult you, you do need to leverage across multiple points and that will increase your complexity. So yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m really excited to see what people are building.</p>



<p>Tarun Chitra (00:25:29):<br>Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think one of the reasons for instance, gnosis&#8217;s on chain exchange is so much, you know, sorry, Martin is so much just, it&#8217;s never going to be used as much as Uniswap is because it relies on this off chain Oracle to actually tell it sort of give it a solution of how to clear the auction because they went with an overly complex kind of design and sometimes overly complex, off chain design is the, is the a theoretically correct design. It solves the problem in some optimal sense, but given the computational constraint of the traders and the trading itself, you kind of have to adapt your strategies to the fact that you&#8217;re in this low compute environment, Ethereum&#8217;s expensive, very variable costs. So do you ever see a world where the strategies are not strictly emulated on chain in the sense that, you know, a lot of the, the types of, you know strategies that people would use them in centralized crypto trading or real, real finance normal trends is, you know, probably a few orders of magnitude more complicated and you don&#8217;t really want running on chain, or do you see actually this kind of new nouveau thing for, for defi as being simple on chain strategies will dominate and have like the highest amount of capital in flow.</p>



<p>Tarun Chitra (00:27:03):<br>So maybe to put another way, do you see the majority of, of capital that is going into these strategies really focusing on the simple but scalable strategies or these kinds of complex, but optimized strategies. And it&#8217;s, if it&#8217;s a latter, do you see a world in which this has to be done off chain or on a different chain?</p>



<p>Hasu (00:27:23):<br>And maybe, maybe to build on your question Tarun like the most extreme version of that, that I can see is that some venture fund or hedge fund starts raising money on Yearn, right. By creating a vault. And then just saying the strategy is, did you trust us to invest this money? And we are going to return it in one year.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:27:48):<br>I may look those, those, all of those possibilities exist. I think that&#8217;s why that&#8217;s why the, the collective governance is important again, to drive where that goes. If, if it&#8217;s down to my personal opinion, I don&#8217;t like things that happen off chain. It&#8217;s the same reason why while I spent most of my time originally normalizing all of the different APR from all of the different lenders. Cause I didn&#8217;t want to make off chain decisions. Even, even with these new farming strategies, they, they, they annoy me a little bit because you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re making in quotes off chain decisions on, you know, is, is COMP currently more valuable or is curve more valuable or I don&#8217;t know. YAM. Or valuable for argument? I, I think, I think the more you do off chain, the more risk you add versus if it&#8217;s, if it&#8217;s on chain, it&#8217;s verifiable, everyone can see it, everyone can do it.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:28:52):<br>That&#8217;s. That&#8217;s where I personally would like to see it. And that&#8217;s where I personally would like it to stay. To me, to me, if it&#8217;s not happening in a CRM it&#8217;s not happening now, now that does not preclude where we might be in a, in a few months and or years from now, when, when we have, you know, a few more layer, two solutions and we have more currently layer one change that ended up becoming, you know, sort of roll up side chains. And, and then that might be a different story because you, you can still verify it at the base ETH layer. But I&#8217;m very hesitant now, again, this is my personal opinion. I mean, it&#8217;s up to, it&#8217;s up to YFI holders to decide, but, but in my personal opinion, I don&#8217;t think any strategies should be used that can&#8217;t a hundred percent be verified chain,</p>



<p>Tarun Chitra (00:29:43):<br>Yeah. I mean, I, I, the only reason I asked is that there&#8217;s also this kind of adverse selection aspect to having everything on chain of, you know, everyone kind of knows what let&#8217;s just say, we&#8217;re in a world where we&#8217;re where Yearn is controlling, like Yearn vaults control, 40% of capital. And so every reallocation transaction that&#8217;s sent sort of has Yearn as, you know, the whale when they actually, when the contract makes a trade, a lot of other people follow or a lot of other people front and run the vault sort of behavior. Do you, do you see that that competition sort of being stable in the long run where, you know, you have manyVaults and they&#8217;re competing and sort of they compete towards towards a single equilibrium or do you see it as a strictly capital aggregation game of whoever is the biggest in terms of vault creation, whether it&#8217;s yam, whether it&#8217;s Yearn, whether it&#8217;s whoever else shows up, ends up kind of dominating. And the reason I ask this is if you stay fully on chain, you actually do expose these strategies to a ton of adverse selection because the code is open source and you can look at the historical transactions and you know, exactly the logic. So yeah, maybe what are your thoughts on that?</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:31:09):<br>Look, I mean, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re opening your competitive advantage and you&#8217;re opening your playbook. There&#8217;s, there&#8217;s no doubt about that. And I currently see it with the vaults. Like when I, when I deploy a new strategy for, for example, the latest one with the, the LINK delegated vault was to borrow TUSD and then put that into stable and put that into the savings because that was doing upwards of 50% APR. And, and that&#8217;s a much higher offset than the more 0.1% you&#8217;re borrowing. And that net benefit is your net result by pressure as well. But, but after deploying that just when I deployed it, there was, there was no TUSD in, in in mStable. And now it&#8217;s kept at, at max cap 55% weight. So, so, and, and I mean the, the, the same with the yCRV and the same with the USDC pools.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:32:06):<br>So, so it&#8217;s already people, people that know how to do these things. They&#8217;ll, they&#8217;ll, they&#8217;ll come to the discord and they&#8217;ll ask people, Hey, what&#8217;s the current strategy? And the reason they&#8217;re asking that is not because their money is in the vault, it&#8217;s because they want to go do it themselves because it&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the easier way to find out what I&#8217;m supposed to do. And, and I mean, in a, in a, in a traditional capitalist sense, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s bad, you know, because obviously you want to protect your IP, your solution, and you want that money in there because that&#8217;s the structure. But, but I think in an open society, that&#8217;s fine. Cause, cause you&#8217;re still going to have, you&#8217;re still gonna have the lazy farmers, you know, the, the guys that don&#8217;t want to do that all the time. I mean, just, just me trying to review the different forks code gave me so much fatigue from fork fatigue that I was at a point where when a new one launched, I was just like, you know what, whatever, I&#8217;ll just do whatever you guys want.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:33:05):<br>I&#8217;m not even gonna look at this anymore. And I think, I think a lot of people we&#8217;ll sort of get to that space as well. And I mean, especially with gas feeds what they are now, you&#8217;re not at a certain point, your, your, your size of investment. It also just makes sense to live in a vault because you don&#8217;t have to worry about those exorbitant gas fees. Because just cause there&#8217;s a lot of solutions that currently don&#8217;t make sense because of that. Now, now again, these inefficiencies will disappear as we move to, to Eth2, or move to roll up solution or layer two solutions. And those things will happen over time. And maybe the market changes to the point where, you know, something like Yearn doesn&#8217;t need to exist in a year from now anymore. It just needs to exist for the problems that are presented now.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:33:47):<br>So, so I I&#8217;d say little bit 50 50 I mean, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s good. So the people can use it, copy the Yearn vaults. And I do actually highly recommend it because create a competitive fee structure there, get it to the point where it&#8217;s a zero sum game and people are just, you know, having zero fee solutions. Cause I think that again, fixes capital inefficiencies. And, and that does obviously subtract value from, from my yearn solution. But I mean, I don&#8217;t see why that&#8217;s bad. If, if, if there&#8217;s more access and, and we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re getting this incredible current, you know, huge APR line down to a more reasonable place. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s fine. I mean the, the, the same arguments, although guess it&#8217;s a little bit different. I want it to say the same argument can be made for, for backs, you know, cause we&#8217;re seeing a lot more digital banks and the barriers for banking is also emerging, but, but banks will always have sort of a regional connectivity.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:34:59):<br>It was a discussion of that on the forum once about, you know, creating different Yearns for different regional and or demographic segments, which also think is good. It goes like one, one of the reasons why I supported, the why I support the YFII fork is because you know, that they&#8217;re there. As they themselves say a Chinese, you know, demographic that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s China focused defi. And that for example, is a demographic that, that me as yearn would not have gotten into because you know, my, my sites don&#8217;t have translations my, my Twitter and stuff. Doesn&#8217;t talk to that crowd. I&#8217;m not on Wechat actively. So, so, so that to me is good. Even though it&#8217;s a competitor because that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a market segment, I would have in any case not touched. So having, having people have access to it is a positive to me. And, and I guess that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s probably where, where my, my perspective will differ from, for example, a YFI token holder, because to them, they want to lock in as much as possible into, into yearn because that&#8217;s the highest, you know, ROI for them on, on their governance participation. But, but to me, the more of these solutions we have and the more inefficiencies we exploited to give more people access. I, I see that as a positive and always,</p>



<p>Hasu (00:36:22):<br>Yeah. So zooming, zooming out a little bit. So I originally thought about Yearn as a sort of hedge fund or like a robo advisor. And I know in a different podcast, you call it a smart savings account, even though you weren&#8217;t quite happy with the name. I think it&#8217;s very fitting, but I think the more we talk about it, the, my, I see it as a actually a two sided marketplace for investing where, on the one side you have the LPs who provide capita. And on the other side, you have strategy providers who provide the extra that investment strategies. So do you agree with this framing?</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:37:03):<br>Hundred percent! So, so, so the way I&#8217;ve been, I&#8217;ve been mentioning that in some of my different talks is, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s the LP who I just want to provide DAI and get my base DAI returns, I don&#8217;t really care what you do with that. And then on the other hand, you have the strategist, which, which is technically, you know, It&#8217;s a it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a capital deployer, it&#8217;s a fund. So like what, what I almost want to see one day which I think will be pretty cool is when, is when there&#8217;s so much capital that, that the strategy writers can actually go to a protocol and, you know broker a better deal. So we will provide this capital, but you need to give us, you know, this rebate or whatever. And I think when we get to that point, then, then it becomes really sexy because then, then the, the power of the capital in itself has weight.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:37:58):<br>And, and, and this is I&#8217;m sorry to sidetrack here a little bit, but, but this is something that I saw with the delegated faults, where, you know, as, as, as individuals and using the LINK vault, as an example, as individuals, a lot of people do take their length. They put it in Aave, they, they borrow USDT and they go put that in curve and they outperform the, the interest that they are paying and they take that difference and they go buy more LINK, and then they put that back into Aave and they keep doing that process. And, and as an individual let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s say a hundred people are doing it that that helps, but it happens at different times at different points in the markets. And now someone skips it, maybe in another one, doesn&#8217;t do it. But when you pool all of this and the vault starts doing it on a, on a consistent basis, you know, it&#8217;s creating this constant by pressure on the side as well.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:38:50):<br>And, and I like to think of the, the vaults sort of as, as their own whales that have their own weight in this ecosystem. And I think we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve seen what they can do in some circumstances. So, so, so definitely, I think the current strategy developers, you know, are, are, are just dudes like me, who are just see, Hey, here&#8217;s a cool way to make a little bit of extra per hour. So let&#8217;s do the strategy. But I think the ones in three months, or six months from now are going to be fairly, fairly sophisticated capital deployers that, that know how to leverage that to their advantage. Because, you know, there&#8217;s if there is, for example, an incentive system in, and of, it makes a lot of sense, you know, add that incentive referral and then deposit all of the funds because your, your, your net benefit is going to be higher than doing it individually across a bunch of different markets. So long story short. Yeah. I agree. A hundred percent with that perspective, you mentioned</p>



<p>Hasu (00:39:48):<br>One actual interesting thing that, you know, what you just said made me think about is there&#8217;s been kind of this rebirth, I think, in crypto of memetic trading cause a normal finance, I think memetic trading sort of died in the two thousands. You know, when I think of memetic trading there, I think of like activist investing and, you know, some guy going on TV and being like X as a scam. And you know, I, I, there&#8217;s an actual interesting thing here where the weight vaults themselves become the memes that trade they&#8217;re, if they&#8217;re they&#8217;re a whale, they kind of are the memetic trade. So, you know, in that sense, do you ever see kind of vaults having memes as lives of their own in the sense that like vault creators or strategy developers develop a whole meme ecosystem around a certain type of strategy and everyone just follows, it becomes a momentum trade more than a sort of raw trade</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:40:45):<br>Like, like almost self fulfilling prophecies with capital deployment. It, I mean, it would be awesome. I wouldn&#8217;t mind, but, but for it&#8217;s it&#8217;s I, I, I don&#8217;t. Okay. So, so, so, so a good example, right, is, is the yCRV vault that started farming YFII. And, and a lot of people attribute, like YFII&#8217;s price decline to, to the vault that&#8217;s constantly, you know, farming and selling and farming and selling. And that creates a lot of I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve started calling them parasitic vaults because they just, you know, leach off of these other governance tokens for, for their own best case. Like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m really actually unhappy with it, but at the same time, it was very interesting to see, but, but I, I traced all of the sell events. And now, while that obviously did make the order book thinner, it was not the thing that kept driving the price down that I saw from, from a lot of the other farmers that were in that ecosystem.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:41:49):<br>But everyone enjoyed the narrative of this vault being this parasite and then feeding off of these other thing. And then, and then a lot of people in, in like discord and telegram, I saw a lot of people start saying, you know, you might as well just sell because the vault is farming it in any case. So there&#8217;s no point in holding it. So, so it induced this idea that if the vault is farming you, you&#8217;re going to decline. So might as well not try. And then everyone else, you know, sell, and that actually creates that prophecy in itself. So, so I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m tempted to say that that&#8217;s already, I&#8217;m already observing that. I I&#8217;d like to see with the, with the delegated vaults, the more positive side where, you know, they&#8217;re constantly buying. So that means on for people that are buying, I definitely prefer the positive narrative over the negative narratives, but, but yeah, I think so.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:42:39):<br>I mean, I know a lot of, I know a lot of on chain traders that, you know, they, they trade based on what they see the whales they do follow. So if they see a whale is in a position and then that will begin to exit that position, they exist that position because they followed that pattern behavior. And I think with the, with the yVaults, if, if they play out well that that concept will be, will be super imposed almost, you know, it&#8217;d be because it&#8217;s happening on a grander scale. Cause now taking the yCRV vault as an example, you know, it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s not one whale you&#8217;re following with $2 million. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s this vault that has 30 million sitting in it at one point 40. So I, I think due to the open nature of what they are doing I can definitely see a culture like that form around it. But again, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s one of those, those fascinating side effects that like, like so much has already happened, that I could not predict them in any kind of design ideas. So, so I actually think that&#8217;ll be really cool.</p>



<p>Hasu (00:43:49):<br>Cool. And in some sense, you know, maybe, maybe this might be a [?] comparison, but do you kind of, you know, my first impression was sort of Yearn was your V2 once you had vaults was really, it was really like Numarai for yield farming. So I think one of the things that, you know, old school crypto investors and people thought was that this notion of kind of memetic slash crowdsource trading would be would really work in the normal markets. But so far I would say it&#8217;s been pretty conclusively, pretty bad. It, whereas I pointed out the yVaults have done quite a good job of this kind of crowdsource trading model, even in one month or, you know, I don&#8217;t know for you, it must feel like it&#8217;s been like a year since. So, so do you see kind of on chain trading as the, you know, what are, what are kind of the advantages for on chain trading that make it so much better for these kinds of crowdsource experiments? Because it does seem, you know, it&#8217;s only been a short amount of time, but I would say it seems like there&#8217;s just such a large advantage and it seems like it&#8217;s working a lot better than it does in the normal market. So maybe do you have any kind of color as to why that happens? Like how the community, why the communities are so much more vibrant? Like w you know, what&#8217;s this, like, what&#8217;s your gut feeling for the secret sauce?</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:45:25):<br>I think it&#8217;s a combination and, and like you said, gut feeling, this is a hundred percent gut feeling. I have no supporting data, but It&#8217;s been one month of craziness, so let&#8217;s not, you know, you have to there&#8217;s no, there&#8217;s no, there&#8217;s no strong statistical inference. Absolutely zero. The, the, the only thing I can comment on, you know, number one is, is the open nature of the vaults. The fact that anyone can see those strategies. And I mean, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s been a lot of sites that have, that have come onto the stage: stats.finance/yearn, feel-the-yearn, all community built and, and all of them have a singular job of, of seeing what the vaults are currently doing. So, so I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s already sort of step one. So versus, you know, in sort of traditional trading markets or, or even if we take it off chain and we, and we just look at the off chain markets it&#8217;s a lot more closed loop. So you, you don&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t necessarily see what that big trader in finance is doing because you can&#8217;t really monitor it as closely.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:46:35):<br>So step one, I think is, is this open nature of the vaults and the strategies themselves, and then thing number two is, is I think the, the access to information is, is a lot easier slash spreads a lot faster. Now, now, again, in traditional finance, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of structures to prevent people from discussing with competitors or, or different groups or, or, or, you know, something that&#8217;s not your LPs maybe, but, but in, in, in, in crypto because of the, the open nature of a theory that that information gets disseminated so quickly. So, so, so what I, what I like to do is I like to watch how long it normally takes from me deploying a strategy on chain, not, not even hooking it up. So, so this is me a strategy for myself that I want to play with because I normally deploy them on Eth and, then play with them for a week or so before I turn them into an official strategy.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:47:38):<br>And, and as soon as I do that, how long until I see people talking about that strategy on different discords or different telegrams, or, or them start discussing it, or, or dissecting it to try and see why it might be better than the current strategy. And, and on average, that&#8217;s within a few hours, you know, where, where if I go back to my traditional banking and finance days, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s not something that happens. You, you didn&#8217;t have access to the other guy&#8217;s playbook. And even if you did, you, you didn&#8217;t share that information. So, so I I&#8217;d say those two qualities are kind of the self fulfilling prophecies, where, where it&#8217;s gotten to the point where, where if a vault switches through the strategy, people go, Oh, okay. That must be the better strategy. Let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s follow along. So I, if I had to wager a guess, I&#8217;d say, I think those two factors largely play in it. But you know, as you said, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s been live for a month and right now there&#8217;s a lot of excitement. And right now there&#8217;s a lot of attention that could very well be a very different picture, you know, six months from now. So, so again, fascinated to see how this evolves, but, but I think there&#8217;s two, there&#8217;s two qualities probably have a large impact on why we&#8217;re seeing the, the, the sort of the mythic nature around it.</p>



<p>Hasu (00:48:58):<br>Yeah. Yeah. I think I fully agree with it. And I think that there is a large, very large demand in this space to just like one button allocate capital and put it to work, but, but in a way that is that the user can understand and that they can trust. And I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s where the big strength of these on chain strategies comes in versus the more discretionary strategies that may be more profitable and a lot harder to like front run and such, but they also demand a lot more trust in the capital locator. So going back to this two sided market place for investing, I would be curious, so what is my, how do you incentivize people to provide strategies in the future?</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:49:46):<br>Gotcha. So, so right now the, the strategy creator gets a percentage of the performance fee. So what I mean by that is, let&#8217;s say, let&#8217;s say the let&#8217;s take the YFII vaults. The strategy there is to is to stake, to form the YFII governance tokens, then to swap that back to, to the to the yCRV LP token of that 0.5% is currently taken as a performance fee on every time that liquidation event occurs, the others go back to the LP. And then of that 0.5, the strategy creator you as let&#8217;s say, 50% or whatever. So, so for now it&#8217;s zero because I&#8217;m the strategy creator. And I don&#8217;t really care about the output. But that&#8217;s the, that&#8217;s the design model to incentivize strategy creators. So as a strategy creator, I want my strategy to be the best, and I want it to be the one used because it has, you know, net recurring benefits for me.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:50:50):<br>But that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s current design. How it, how it ends up looking, I think might be very different. Maybe it&#8217;s a, maybe it&#8217;s a inflation model where, you know, tokens are assigned to strategy creators when, when it comes to sort of the, the incentivization slash fee structure modules, I&#8217;m largely throwing that out up into the air for, for the governance participates to, to discuss and vote on, because I don&#8217;t consider myself an expert in that area. And then to see, but yeah, so, so currently as we speak now it&#8217;s a percentage of performance fee what it ends up being, who knows.</p>



<p>Hasu (00:51:29):<br>Yeah. So in a marketplace for an, an open marketplace for investment strategies I think we have pretty substantial evidence that the, the lowest fee strategies are attracting the most capital. We see this in the passive investment space and traditional finance where the, the ETF has one basically has the dominant investment vehicle and among ETFs, the ones that have the lowest total expense ratio, they dominate the market. So given that strategies basically pay some amount of fees to the governors, the, the, the YFI holders and also pay some amount of fees to the actual strategy provider. Do you think that the end game is going to be that basically any strategy, any, or like the strategy providers and the YFI holders, they become one because if someone already holds YFI, then they can, and they can benefit from already getting the fees that way. Do you think that that they can offer a more competitive product in the market, cheaper?</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:52:46):<br>I mean, look where wherever you cut down fees you&#8217;re going to be better off. So, so, so my rule right now with these vaults is I just need to be outperforming any competitor. And that difference that&#8217;s free game to governance. Like, like maybe because I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m fine with putting my money in there, on, on that basis. So, you know, I&#8217;m not, it doesn&#8217;t have to be earning 22%. It&#8217;s fine if it&#8217;s earning 20%, because it means I don&#8217;t have to spend all that time researching and deciding where to go and, you know, swapping it myself and gas and et cetera, et cetera. But because there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of hidden expenses that actually that&#8217;s different topic, but let me quickly just touch on too, that there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of hidden expenses that people don&#8217;t calculate into their yield farm, you know, so, so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s always an, and I&#8217;m guilty of this myself, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a metric I want to get rid of, but, but this idea of, of daily APR daily growth, annualized, and then you say this is APR is actually a gross misrepresentation.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:53:47):<br>Cause, cause even if you&#8217;re talking about let&#8217;s say a hundred percent APR currently, this is what you annualized from the last 24 hours change. So, so let&#8217;s say you have $10,000. You want to invest. Now. Now you might be excited to, to swap from your current strategy to there because so much higher rates currently. But you know, if your money was there in the last 24 hours, on 10,000, you would have had 27 bucks. And that&#8217;s very quickly offset by the gas fees. You&#8217;re just paid to do that migration from the withdrawal on the one side and the deposit on the other side. So, so, so that, that&#8217;s more back on the original topic of, you know, what, what is my net result of growth minus fees, minus research minus time. But to answer the question in a straightforward as possible, I have always considered it to be a little bit of a zero sum game because with the open access of information and the quick dissemination offset information, it is possible to have competitors that are just going to be zero.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:54:55):<br>It&#8217;s also possible. And, and I think this is why, you know, we have we have competitive pricing rules and a bunch of different things like this and traditional markets, because it&#8217;s also possible that a bunch of these yield aggregators decide they&#8217;re all gonna charge 5% and that&#8217;s the next standard. And that&#8217;s also on the bad side of the spectrum. The, the honest answer is I don&#8217;t have a clue. We&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll see how it evolves. I think, I think there is more than enough capital available and different appetites that there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of room for a lot of different solutions and a lot of different pricing models.</p>



<p>Tarun Chitra (00:55:36):<br>One, one quick comment is a, you know, I know there&#8217;s this campaign, not just from you, but for many people to to, to get rid of APR, but the normal markets have not even still moved to full market cap weighted indexes, they&#8217;re still [?] So it might take forever.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:55:59):<br>Yeah. Look, I actually tweeted it earlier today that, that, you know, the, the new daily APR that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the, that&#8217;s the circulating supply via versus fully diluted market cap argument. I mean, you, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a statement that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean anything and you can, you can use that information. I&#8217;m just, I&#8217;m just worried about the impression it creates for the uninformed user, because I&#8217;m like, like, like when I was doing this back in, back in early year, like, like Jan Feb March, I, I felt a lot more confident that the people putting their money into these systems had a lot more information and knowledge to how the systems were working. And, and I think it was a crowd that wanted a little bit more responsibility, you know, like, like when, when, when they put in there their a hundred dollars, they want to know exactly where is that hundred dollars.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:56:58):<br>And at any given point of time, I want to go see where is that hundred dollars. And, and these last few months have filled me with so much fear because the, the amount of capital going into the systems and the speed at which they&#8217;re going into these systems clearly tells me that, that, that sort of, that wants to be informed has, has completely flown out of the window. And then right now people are just yellowing into whatever they see as the highest APR, right, without actually considering what their net result is, you know, minus gas, minus opportunity costs and what that is in aggregate. Cause you go, if you go look on the Yearn V1 vault, you you&#8217;ll see, they report their APR as, as realized, you know, so if you had to put in $1 and day one, how much percentage growth has there been till now?</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:57:49):<br>And that&#8217;s often not a sexy number. You know, it might be 8%, but, but now in a, in a, in a given block, the borrowing on sUSD can spike to the point where it&#8217;s at 64%. And then, then I, and I, I did fall victim to this early, when I started, but I&#8217;m vehemently avoiding it currently. Then, then it is fun to, to jump on Twitter and report that 65% because that&#8217;s cool. But at the same time, now someone moves their funds expecting 65% consistently. And, you know, just because it was 65 for a block and the rest of the time it was North 0.1, isn&#8217;t, isn&#8217;t going to get you what you think you&#8217;re getting. And, and, and that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m worried. So, so I think it was fine reporting it six months ago because the capital flowing in was informed capital.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:58:40):<br>And I mean, I, I don&#8217;t say this with any disrespect, but, but I just feel like a lot of the capital that&#8217;s being deployed now is, is not informed capital. I, yeah, I I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m just worried about that kind of stuff. And, and the more I&#8217;m seeing the inflows, the more I&#8217;m worried about how we are representing this information to the outside world. But at the same time, I also see when I tweet about something like this, I get zero engagement, but when I tweet 170% APR, then, you know, it&#8217;s shared in like 4,000 times. So, so, so clearly the crowds are speaking and they&#8217;ve, they&#8217;ve made their decision. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m noticing we&#8217;re back. We&#8217;re back in that, in that market space where we&#8217;re now, when, when you point out that, Hey, there might be a riskier or, Hey, be careful, you&#8217;re you, you get attacked and flooded versus, you know, six months ago when you pointed that out, it was shared to the extent that everyone knew.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (00:59:39):<br>And, and I mean, I show that even happened with, with the article Hasu did, where, where, you know, I saw people attacking him for it. And I was like, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s important that the stuff gets shared. Like, I don&#8217;t know. Anyway, I posted it a few days ago as well, where, you know, I, I told people that they shouldn&#8217;t get attached to these numbers cause there&#8217;s so much emotional attachment to these numbers. And, and that, that in itself is dangerous as well. But, but sorry, guys, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m going off on a completely different tangent now.</p>



<p>Hasu (01:00:11):<br>I, yeah, I really liked that you would post the, the realized yields instead of the APR. I just think it&#8217;s super important to like train your users in the right way. And I mean, we&#8217;ve seen with stuff like impermanent loss, which I think has also caused a lot of damage property to LPs, just this name and the expectations that it creates and how misleading it is. I think that these things can, can take, take a life of their own really quickly. So it matters like getting the naming and the expectations right.</p>



<p>Andre Cronje (01:00:47):<br>Yeah. And yeah, I like, like, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re always going to have that sector of people that are not going to care about that. And, you know, they&#8217;re just going to want to report the big numbers because they want to attract as much as they can for whatever reason it is they want. But yeah, I agree. I think we need to start standardizing some of these things and reporting them in similar fashions because most, most of the, most of the aggregate sites I see now that report APR are doing daily adjusted. And I, I just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a good metric.</p>



<p>Hasu (01:01:24):<br>This concludes the first part of our interview with Andre. In the second part, which we’ll release in a few days, we focus on governance both in Yearn and in DeFi systems in general. Governance, in my opinion, is not only the hottest topic in crypto right now with many projects releasing their governance tokens at insane valuation, but also one of the most misunderstood. I can’t wait to share that discussion with you. See you next time!</p>

  <p>We all stood behind the money printer go brrr meme. We need to live up to what we preach.</p>♦<blockquote>Cognitive Dissonance, noun</blockquote><blockquote>the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change.</blockquote><blockquote>(Oxford Dictionary)</blockquote><p>We all like to think that we’re changing the world with this thing called crypto; reiterating upon a flawed financial system through decentralization, disintermediation and open access for all. After all, Bitcoin was created on the brink of the worst financial calamity in almost a century, when the opacity and cronyism of 21st century finance threatened to destroy value of an unprecedented scale.</p><p>While quantitative easing and bailouts were increasing the complexity of global economies and blurring the role of central banks, Bitcoin was being legitimized as a transparent and provably fair alternative. The successful bootstrap of its network gave birth to an entire industry that converged around the ethos of decentralization and openness.</p><p>We have embraced this ethos to build Unstoppable Applications, Decentralized Finance and Personal Banks in what’s often promoted as an entirely new financial system.</p><p>However, when it comes to living up to these ideals, there are times that crypto disappoints. There are times when it seems like instead of reiterating upon the opaque financial system we’ve inherited, crypto is merely replicating it. The debates that took place this week around supply transparency perfectly encapsulated this cognitive dissonance. It started with a seemingly simple question:</p>“What is the total supply of ETH?”<p>This question broke Crypto Twitter. As many found out, the answer turns out to be “it’s complicated.”</p>♦Source: CoinDesk Research<p>CoinDesk Research compiled the responses from 5 different data providers, and, as shown above, there is no consensus. Some respondents pointed at custom scripts, blockchain explorers and third-party querying tools; all of which highlighted an undeniable issue: there is no definitive answer. And instead of an overdue discussion on why there isn’t consensus on ETH’s supply, the conversation got dismissed with a blank “it’s hard to calculate it”.</p>“It’s hard to calculate it” is a bad answer<p>We all know it’s hard to calculate it. No Ethereum client (the software required to become a node on the network) features a standardized way to verify total supply of Ether. Since Ethereum’s account-based data structure was built from the ground up, it has always been a hard exercise to make assessments on supply, especially in comparison to Bitcoin and all of its forks.</p><p>For context, Bitcoin Core (Bitcoin’s main client) features a command called gettxoutsetinfo that grants any user the ability to audit Bitcoin’s supply for themselves. This is part of Bitcoin’s RPC command line, which, put simply, is an interface that allows users to perform the equivalent to API calls on their own nodes to do things like query wallet balances, broadcast transactions, amongst other functions. Gettxoutsetinfo sums up all valid Bitcoin balances (UTXOs) visible to a user’s node at any point in time and lands on a single BTC supply figure.</p><p>Ethereum, on the other hand, has features that make this calculation process considerably more difficult on a relative basis. For example, Ethereum blocks are appended to its blockchain at a fast rate (every ~15 seconds) through so-called uncle/ommer blocks. These are blocks found roughly at the same time by different miners. Instead of selecting one or the other, the protocol “merges” them together. The reward is then split between miners based on the composition of their blocks, which complicates the tracking of ETH issuance.</p><p>Then, there are the idiosyncrasies of complex smart contracts that require data providers and blockchain explorers to adopt their own methodologies to account for who owns what, when. Then, there are rounding heuristics at the discretion of the party making the calculation. In order to deal with these idiosyncrasies, anyone trying to land on an authoritative estimate of ETH’s supply is required to make methodological decisions at their own discretion; decisions that will ultimately skew the final figure. So, yes, this is by no means an easy exercise.</p><p>However, it was odd to see people fixate on the difficulty of the calculation and fail to acknowledge that the lack of consensus on the total supply of ETH is a valid concern. It was particularly weird to see pushback coming from people whose full time job is to promote the ideals of decentralization and openness.</p><blockquote>However, it was odd to see people fixate on the difficulty of the calculation and fail to acknowledge that the lack of consensus on the total supply of ETH is a valid concern.</blockquote><blockquote>It was particularly weird to see pushback coming from people whose full time job is to promote the ideals of decentralization and openness.</blockquote><p>Perhaps all the ad hominem that tend to follow any sentence with an implicit or explicit “Bitcoin vs Ethereum” comparison in them has clouded people’s judgement. But make no mistake, this lack of consensus should be taken seriously, especially if you care about ETH. The importance of strong assurances around a cryptoasset’s supply go far beyond transparency and auditability — it’s also very much a matter of security.</p><p>Consider that Bitcoin Core is as old as this industry itself and also enjoys a large portion of its developer mindshare. Nevertheless, it still experienced a couple of inflation bugs in its history. Ethereum clients are not infallible, and without a standardized RPC routine to audit ETH’s supply, potentially catastrophic bugs become harder to find.</p><p>With this in mind, the cavalier attitude seen on crypto twitter towards the lack of consensus on supply data should come as both odd and concerning. In the interest of not making generalizations, I must acknowledge that there were in fact members of the Ethereum community that not only recognized the severity of this issue, but were also brave enough to call out the cognitive dissonance — kudos to them.</p>“No right way to calculate it” is the right answer<p>At this point, any estimate of ETH’s total supply is as good as the methodology employed. CoinMetrics has done a lot of work to abstract away any subjectivity from our total ETH supply methodology. We’ve even gone through the effort of developing a new data model to audit the supply of various cryptoassets. This model converts blockchain data into the double-entry booking format, which is particularly useful to track inflation (subscribe to our State of the Network newsletter for future updates on this).</p><p>When we applied this data model and accompanying methodology to Ether, we have found that our total ETH supply figures very closely match Etherscan’s, Ethereum’s largest blockchain explorer. This is generally good news given Etherscan’s importance to the Ethereum ecosystem. However, albeit minor, there was still a 0.00052 ETH discrepancy found by Coin Metric’s In-House-Blockchain-Indiana-Jones, Antoine Le Calvez:</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@khannib</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}<p>We believe Etherscan made a tiny rounding error in the block referenced in the tweet, but without looking into their methodology, it is hard to say. This highlights that, without a protocol-defined methodology to calculate supply, it is very unlikely that two parties will agree on what Ether’s total supply is, at least at the decimals level. And as much as I want you to trust Coin Metric’s data (knowing the care that goes into calculating it), this should be no replacement for the ability to verify it for yourself.</p>♦As of Block Height 10648267, Ether’s supply stood at 112,155,515.65573If you care about ETH, take this criticism seriously and call your local Geth maintainer<p>The other good news is that this is an issue that can probably be fixed. Just like with AA, step number #1 is to acknowledge that there’s a problem. Step number 2 is to convince the maintainers of popular Ethereum clients, like Geth, Parity and OpenEthereum to build an RPC subroutine that converges on a single methodology to calculate total supply and issuance.</p><p>In order to truly live up to values of openness and decentralization, the equivalent to gettxoutsetinfo should be very minimum benchmark for any crypto asset. It’s a seemingly small feature, but a requirement for any objective assurances around supply. This is particularly important for more experimental cryptonetworks such as Ethereum, as an equivalent RPC would would allow ETH users to have better clarity around supply, especially in the event a bug makes ETH issuance inadvertently go brrr. It also simplifies the job of third parties by providing a protocol-level methodology we can follow.</p>♦

  <p>By Ross Ulbricht</p>♦<p>I recently wrote this article about the Maker Protocol. The protocol is an Ethereum application that supports DAI, and DAI is a token that tracks the value of the US dollar. One of the hardships of prison is access to information. It can take weeks or months through the mail to research even a small topic or get a specific piece of data. Something that might take mere minutes with Internet access. So, I published that article without verifying some data, wanting to get it out while the mid-March crisis was still somewhat recent.</p><p>I had received values for the savings rate and stability fee, and they confirmed my hypothesis, but they were values from different days. I assumed the stability fee was less than the savings rate all the time because I didn’t realize how often and dramatically the rates were being changed. The best data I could come up with since then puts both rates around 8% pre-crisis, with the savings rate dropping to 0% post-crisis. I had recommended the savings rate be set to zero in the article, and so far, it has stayed there.</p><p>The fact that the stability fee is higher than the savings rate doesn’t change the points I raised in the article, it just means there is some other explanation for why people are putting ether into Maker vaults. The best explanation I have come across is that they are using it for financial leverage. They issue DAI backed by ether and then sell it for more ether. If the price of ether goes up, they make more than if they were just holding the original ether. But if the price goes down, they run into trouble because they have to try to recapitalize with a depreciating asset. As noted in the article, that’s what happened in mid-March when the price of ether suddenly fell by half.</p><p>As a prisoner, I am very fortunate to have people willing to do research and work with me through the mail. I am a rare exception. Most are very cut off from all but the most mainstream sources (CNN, Fox, NPR). Even so, it is a challenge to get all the details right on a topic like this. Thank you for pointing out the mistakes and bearing with me.</p>♦

  ♦<p>In response to Reed Wommack and John Vallis discussing Bitcoin and Scarcity www.pscp.tv/w/1PlJQNzqAMBxE</p><p>While writing these words, I’ve just finished listening to Reed Wommack’s conversation with John Vallis. Both Reed and John are great thinkers and I’m proud to have connected and interacted with them both on several occasions. In the conversation, the abstract concept of “AlienCoin” was brought up. Imagine that a species of alien makes contact with earth and that we start trading with them. They’re using AlienCoin, a type of money with similar properties to Bitcoin but with a longer history and overall better properties. It is, in other words, a better Bitcoin. Would we humans switch to this coin or not in our search for an absolutely scarce asset that can be used as money?</p><p>I’ve written a lot about the concept of absolute digital scarcity and how it was more of a discovery than an invention and how it could only be discovered once. This is my definition of it, from Bitcoin — Independence Reimagined:</p><p>The One Shot Principle:</p><p>Absolute mathematical scarcity achieved by consensus in a sufficiently decentralized distributed network was a discovery rather than an invention. It cannot be achieved again by a network made up of participants aware of this discovery, since the very thing discovered was resistance to replicability itself.</p><p>Hal Finney said it like this:</p><p>“Any successful replacement of the Bitcoin block chain will forever undermine the credibility of any successor. How is an investor to know that it won’t happen again? Rebooting now may benefit a few thousand early adopters. What happens when hundreds of millions use Bitcoin 2.0? They’ll be just as jealous and envious of you as you are of others. Given the precedent you want to set, how will you argue against yet another reboot?”</p><p>In the interview, Reed mentions that there’s probably a finite amount of say, Bitcoin Cash as well as Bitcoin. This is not how I see it. As I’ve mentioned before, scarcity is all about how you choose to frame it. If you see Bitcoin Cash as a “Forks-of-Bitcoin”-token, it is not scarce. There are thousands of those. Around the time when these fork-coins were popular, there was a website where you could create your own by just a few clicks. My point about the discovery of scarcity on the internet is that we needed to frame this as soon and as rigidly as possible in order for it to actually work. I believe that the early history of Bitcoin was that framing process. It is not over yet. The fact that the Bitcoin Cash fork didn’t really work was one of the main things that convinced me that Bitcoin was actually decentralized enough to not give in to proposed monetary policy changes pushed onto the project from the outside. It could only be changed from within and I concluded that this was so unlikely that it would almost certainly never happen.</p><p>Now onto AlienCoin, a very fascinating concept indeed. Even though the probability of the scenario ever happening is probably close to zero, it’s a thrilling thought experiment nonetheless. A scenario like this wouldn’t even have to involve aliens, let’s just say that we discovered another decentralized computer network with better properties and more proof of work than Bitcoin somehow. I would still stick to Bitcoin and so should (and most likely would) everyone else. I’ll try to explain why.</p><p>Have you ever played Sid Meier’s Civilization? In every incarnation of the game there’s a technology tree. Some technologies are prerequisites for others. Bitcoin is standing on the shoulders of giants. Not only did it require cryptography, hashing algorithms, merkle trees and ASICs to function properly but before that mathematics, writing, hexadecimals, semiconductors, microprocessors, computer graphics and probably the wheel, agriculture, pottery and even ceremonial burial or archery as well. The point is that time moves in one direction and one direction only. The order in which events play out have a huge impact on the results. If you dry yourself off before you shower, you will have a very different result than if you do it afterwards. This is true for Bitcoin’s own history as much as it is true for whatever historical events that played out before it was discovered as well. Each day that passes, Bitcoin becomes more “Lindy”. People have a more and more concise view of what it is, and what history it has. Bitcoin was fairly distributed among humans because the earlier you got in, the higher the risk you took. More risk, more reward. I wasn’t truly 100% convinced of Bitcoin’s functionality until the Bcash fork happened and the users resisted the will of more than 90% of the Bitcoin companies by running their own nodes. An alien coin would have to convince every hodler of last resort on earth that switching to the new coin would be a good idea before they’d part from their bitcoins. Like I said earlier, scarcity is all about how we frame it. The hodlers have agreed already. They hodl Bitcoin, nothing else. The thing about this philosophy is that we’ve already decided what the finite unit for wealth transfer we have is Bitcoin. An AlienCoin would just be another altcoin, even if it functioned as Bitcoin for the aliens. At least for a very long time. In order for anyone that has lived through the early years of Bitcoin to change their mind, they would have to be convinced of the superiority of this new system and that would take a long time, if it’s possible at all. What guarantees do we have that another, even more superior system wouldn’t show up the next day?</p><p>Bitcoin is a four dimensional invention. The direction of time itself plays a huge part in what is. Having doubts about it is a fools game because the organism works and grows precisely because we believe it does. It feeds on human incentives and the more you learn about its connection to praxeology and thermodynamics the more convinced you become. This makes the system even more robust and valuable which will onboard, and convince even more users every day and on and on it goes. It is the optimist’s version of Roko’s basilisk. If we ever interact and trade with aliens in the future, we should exchange all sorts of things with them but we’d better hold on to our most valuable possession. The thing that makes us a type 1+ civilization on the Kardashev scale instead of just a 0,7 one. The best thing we have. The pinnacle of our achievements.</p><p>Some of us have been in Bitcoin longer than others and we’re all at different stages in our perception of it. I’m not saying that I’m 100% right and that everyone else is wrong, but I have come to realize one thing. This rabbit hole is way deeper than any of us can imagine.</p><p>Loved the conversation guys, now I can’t get AlienCoin out of my head! A final question: How do you know Satoshi wasn’t an alien in the first place?</p>♦

  ♦MOON TIARA MAGIC<p>In The United States District Court for the District of Columbia, “UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. LARRY DEAN HARMON”, Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell (a ‎Barack Hussein Obama appointee) made a problematic ruling on the nature of Bitcoin, relying only on hearsay and third party sources, which misguided her to a totally wrong conclusion. Here we dissect the part of the judgement that mischaracterises Bitcoin. It is full of errors, and should not have been used to make the judgement.</p><p>Bitcoin is not “a decentralized form of electronic or digital currency that exists only on the internet”. Bitcoin is a database, copies of which are held by people who download a piece of software to run it. Bitcoin is also not “an alternative currency” and simply asserting that it is does not make it so. Bitcoin is never transferred anywhere. Entries are made in the publicly visible database. No one “owns” Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin has units does not confer the property of money to it. For example, memory storage devices and rulers have units but are not considered money.</p><p>Any proof that Bitcoin has a characteristic cannot come from case law or a layman. An accurate description that is not description by analogy is possible in this matter, and in every instance this is the only description that should be submitted to any court in any proceeding. Relying on second hand descriptions of what Bitcoin is is not necessary, and it is not correct to describe discreet technical operations and devices by analogy only.</p><p>Bitcoin is not “an alternative currency”. It is a database. Bitcoin transactions are entries in a database, which is identical in nature to all other databases where information is stored. The numbers in the Bitcoin database can represent literally anything, because it is data. The idea that Bitcoin is money rests solely in the minds of the people who choose to treat Bitcoin as money. It is not actual money itself. Bitcoin is never transferred anywhere. Bitcoin users sign messages and write them to the global database. Nothing is transferred from one person to another in Bitcoin, and ownership is never transferred in Bitcoin; all data in the Bitcoin network is a property of the Bitcoin database, and not of any particular user.</p><p>The capitalisation conventions in Bitcoin have no bearing on the nature of Bitcoin, and have been adopted by people desperate to try and contextualise Bitcoin. Anyone can make a copy of the Bitcoin network’s database and call it something else, with its own naming conventions. That would not make any aspect of the copy money. It is not true that “tokens” are transferred in Bitcoin. The use of the word “token” emerged from users of Social Media attempting to contextualise Bitcoin through analogy. At no point is Bitcoin ever a “token”, like a subway token or ticket.</p><p>Units of Bitcoin are not stored by reference to an address. Bitcoin addresses are keys used to sign messages that are sent to the network for storage. The authors making this false claims cited in the memorandum admit themselves that they are analogising the address to a user name and that addresses are similar to a bank account number, both of which are absolutely false.</p><p>Bitcoin is never transferred from one address to another. Bitcoin is always sent to the network and stored. The controller of a Bitcoin address never receives anything, because nothing is transferred. Bitcoin users scan the database to see if a message signed to their key has been written to the database. This is not “reception” in any sense, because the location of the “recipient” is immaterial. People on the ground seeing skywriting are not, “recipients of messages”, they are viewers only. This is how Bitcoin works. The nodes that store copies of the Bitcoin database are not linked together; they are all separate and totally independent of each other.</p><p>The “sending” and “receiving” terms in Bitcoin are analogies adopted by the computer illiterate public to help them contextualise Bitcoin’s internal processes. Bitcoin confirmations are records on the database, and nothing more. Bitcoin is no different in function to forum software that makes note of what author wrote what text. The only difference being that people have unilaterally chosen to accept messages in lieu of money. This is a choice the public has made that has nothing to do with Bitcoin’s nature, and there have been several other attempts to do what Bitcoin does that the public refused to accept. All of these systems relied on databases, and the only difference between them all is the public’s acceptance.</p><p>Bitcoin addresses are not owned by anyone. They are pieces of text that have a context in the Bitcoin database. Users of Bitcoin have the power to sign messages with keys they keep secret, but they are not owners of those strings and neither are they owners of the copies of the database they use to verify messages. The only way a claim that users “own” keys is to suffix with “in the ordinary sense of the word”, which is not sufficient for a court proceeding where only material facts are to be taken into consideration.</p><p>Bitcoin keys can be stored in many media like any other text, or no media at all, in the form of memorised words. To make the claim that a set of memorised words is money stretches the credulity of even the most stupid person. Bitcoin is not money, has never been money, and is text only. It is always text, all the time, and you cannot assert that it is money because a computer illiterate author asserts that it is because he wants to sell a book.</p><p>Similarly, no amount of case law can turn Bitcoin into money. The genetically modified seed that grew the tree of “Bitcoin is money” found its genesis with computer illiterates and ambulance chasers desperate to sell books and run crony capitalist front foundations to control this new phenomenon. They don’t have the language or understanding to classify Bitcoin, and those that have the intelligence to do so, quickly realise that they can’t possibly tell the truth, or their new careers as Bitcoin gatekeepers and “Thought Leaders” will be over. They know that Bitcoin is just a database that people accept for accounting. It is as dull and pedestrian as that, and you can’t run a “Legal Centre” or be a “Thought Leader” in something boring and mundane as an Excel spreadsheet.</p><p>The various guides written for “Legal Professionals” will all need to be deprecated and replaced with works that accurately describe how Bitoin works without analogies, comparing its operation to other databases that are in common use. This is the only way the “Legal Professional” and the courts will ever be able to rule on Bitcoin correctly. If they do not, then all databases on earth will be subject to the same rulings that have been made against users of Bitcoin.</p><p>It will mean that all online video game companies could be sued for being “Money Transmitters” because users can trade in game goods between each other. None of the judgements against Bitcoin users make a distinction that separates game monies with Bitcoin, and the mere difference in operation does not count as a difference in nature. Both Bitcoin and MySQL (a database) are databases working with the same thing; data, or plain text.</p><p>In order to say that Bitcoin is different to MySQL in law, a distinction would need to be made so that math operations required for Bitcoin are legally distinct, separate and controlled. This would be a direct violation of the Constitution, and impossible in the USA.</p><p>Operating a Bitcoin full node or sending messages to the network is not “Money Transmission”, even if the service is paid for. If you accept money to transmit a message to the Bitcoin network you are no different to a telegraph operator. You can charge by whatever means you see fit to perform this service, per word or per character, and this is the same in Bitcoin, because the database entries are scarce. You therefore, in order to run a business, need to charge sufficient money to make a profit and replace your Bitcoin so you can continue to send messages on the network. This is not “Money Transmission” and Bitcoin has no official price either. If the price of Bitcoin by agreement of the two parties using the network is agreed to be 0, does this mean that the act is still money transmission, or not? These are the difficult questions that people who assert that Bitcoin is money cannot and will not answer, because they’re either ignorant or they know the truth and want to obscure it for their own personal gain.</p><p>In no way is writing messages on a database “engaging in the business of receiving money for transmission or transmitting money within the United States, or to locations abroad, by any and all means, including but not limited to payment instrument, wire, facsimile, or electronic transfer.” If this were not the case, every text message that had a number in it could be construed as “Money Transmission” if the two parties agreed to a fee to send or receive text. When your accounts are prepared by H&amp;R Block, and they send you the forms to sign, you have paid them for this service. Their records are kept on a database, and you sign and return the forms for a fee. This is no different to Bitcoin.</p><ol><li>A text is prepared</li><li>You sign the text with your unique signature</li><li>You return the text for storage in a database</li><li>You are charged for the service by a service provider</li></ol><p>The database used is irrelevant, and so is the means of identifying you and the method used to identify you by a signature. By this, you can see that H&amp;R Block is, “running a Blockchain”, and their name should be changed to “H&amp;R Blockchain”.</p><p>Bitcoins are not funds, any more than your accounts or text messages are “funds”. Calling Bitcoin funds is an analogy used to put Bitcoin in a context. Similarly, in the definition of Money Transfer, “electronic transfer” applies only to dollars sent through the traditional banking network. It does not apply to any other context, and cannot, because if it did, it would capture all electronic transfers of any kind that contained an explicit representation of money, reference to money or number.</p><p>Bitcoin Tumblers are not “MTAs”. If any court asserts that they are, they will be capturing all dice on earth. A Bitcoin tumbler is nothing more than a computer programme that randomises numbers in a database. It does not accept money as inputs and does not output money either. It takes numbers as inputs, performs calculations on them and then outputs different numbers. This operation has nothing to do with money, and in fact could be done manually with a pencil and paper.</p><p>Bitcoin is not a medium of exchange, method of payment, or store of value. For certain, only a fool would assert that Bitcoin is a store of value, since it has historically been very bad at doing that in fiat terms. Bitcoin is not a method of payment either; people have chosen to use it to pay for goods and services, but that doesn&#39;t make Bitcoin a method of payment. People can use bananas to pay for goods and services, that doesn’t make them a method of payment. Bitcoin is not a medium of exchange either; it is a database of numbers. Numbers can be used to represent anything, and so can Bitcoin. People agree that it is a medium of exchange today. They may not in the future. That has nothing to do with the nature of Bitcoin. Common parlance does not change the nature of things, and defendants claiming that Bitcoin is money does not make Bitcoin money. Slave owners could testify in court that people he owns are “his property” and only a terribly immoral person would assert that because a defendant said this that people are transformed into property. The same is true of Bitcoin.</p><p>Courts do not have the power to claim that human beings are property for the purposes of a judgement, and they do not have the power to create a form of money out of thin air. Only the Congress and Senate have the power to say what money is in the United States. The ordinary meaning of money is also not applicable, as is the Appeal to the People fallacy. The court cannot prove what it is asserting about Bitcoin, and it refers to fallacious arguments to do so without making any direct reference to what Bitcoin is. This should tell you that the court doesn’t know what Bitcoin is and it simply wanted to punish a man who very foolishly sold drugs online.</p><p>Relying on other courts is also faulty. Those courts are similarly ignorant of what Bitcoin is, and are all referring to the same fundamentally flawed material to make their wrong judgements. “The federal district courts have unanimously and unequivocally concluded that Bitcoin constitutes money.” This unanimity is the Faulty Appeal to Authority Fallacy. The court is not showing us what Bitcoin is, it is merely telling us what other people have said it is and it is relying on its “overwhelming authority” to badger, bully and railroad.</p><p>All of this is enough for a higher, neutral court to reject this flawed ruling and dismiss it. Further to this, this ruling has no effect outside of the District of Columbia and cannot not affect any business in another jurisdiction, like BitMEX in Hong Kong or the thousands of companies that will inevitably be formed to work on the new global database.</p><p>This judgement is vindictive and designed to punish someone who made a very bad mistake and accepted Bitcoin in return for services that are illegal in the USA. By making this entirely erroneous judgement, the court is damaging the reputation of the District of Columbia as a place to do global business with the Bitcoin database. Fortunately, billions are already being made outside of the District world-wide, and this judgement is moot everywhere on earth but there.</p>♦<p>Misjudging Bitcoin was originally published in Decentralize.Today on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>♦</p>
<p>On July 17, 2010, two trading parties matched for the first time on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange when 20 bitcoin changed hands for just under a dollar. The exact price of that first trade was $0.04951 per whole bitcoin.</p>
<p>Prior to the trade on Mt. Gox, real-world goods had been exchanged for Bitcoin, but the existence of an electronic matching venue changed the game. Finding a trading partner on an automated electronic exchange is far simpler than making forum posts or jumping into IRC rooms. In July 2010, real-time Bitcoin price discovery began in earnest.</p>
The First Bitcoin Trade
<p>The exact specifications of the first Bitcoin trade:</p>
<pre><code>Time: 2010-07-17 23:09:17 UTC
Amount: 20.00000000 BTC
Price: $0.04951
Value: $0.9902
</code></pre><p>At that moment ten years ago, the height of the blockchain was 68,773, and the total issued supply of Bitcoin was 3,438,650. A quick multiplication places the market cap of Bitcoin at roughly $170,000 at the time of the first Mt. Gox trade.</p>
If They Never Sold
<p>Though it’s probably not the case, let’s assume for a moment that the buyer of those first coins on Mt. Gox held that 20 bitcoin until today, when the price is $9,109 per coin. The return on the dollar invested would be roughly 184,000&times;!</p>
<p>Looking back to these early prices and seeing that Bitcoin has gained in value by more than five orders of magnitude offers a bit of perspective to those impatient for further price appreciation. Too often, new Bitcoiners think they’re not early enough and they missed the boat. And every now and then, the value of Bitcoin rockets by another order of magnitude or two.</p>
Bumps and Milestones Along the Way
<p>Around two months after the first trade, Bitcoin had doubled to pass the 10 cent milestone on September 14, 2010. Not long thereafter, Bitcoin dropped a full 90% to reach is all-time low of $0.01 on October 8, 2010. One lucky buyer snagged a full 100 bitcoin for a penny each.</p>
<p>Dollar parity would not come until February 9, 2011. Bitcoin would trade at $10 on June 2, 2011, already up 1000&times; over its ultimate low nine months earlier.</p>
My Journey
<p>Shortly after Bitcoin reached $1.00 in February 2011, I learned about the project. At the time, I was interested in markets and trading, so I gravitated toward the free and open real-time market data coming from Mt. Gox. By the time I announced my first Bitcoin website on the forum in early June 2011, Bitcoin had already climbed past $10.</p>
<p>Over the intervening years, my projects have always had something to do with the market data side of Bitcoin. It wasn’t until the launch of my Dashboard that I presented network-level stats with the same real-time focus that I dedicated to market data projects.</p>
<p>The markets have matured, and now we have dozens of spot exchanges, regulated derivatives products, 100&times; leverage casinos, and auto-buy stacking apps. There are wallets for the streets and cash-only coordinators for private Bitcoin acquisition. In the middle of it all, there is free and open data. Without the free data feeds from exchanges and the blockchain, sites like mine would have taken much longer to appear. Certainly my first Bitcoin website wouldn’t exist.</p>
The Road Ahead
<p>♦</p>
<p>Over the course of the last ten years, the market cap of Bitcoin has gone from $170k to $170B. We’ve crashed 90%, and we’ve rallied 100&times;. Each order of magnitude increase in price brings a new cohort of profit-seekers, skeptics, opportunists, scammers, entrepreneurs, developers, hobbyists, and folks who finally have to figure out what’s going on with that magic internet money. Somehow this thing never seems to die.</p>
<p>Each wave of volatility brings a new batch of memes, startups, hacks, bankruptcies, liquidations, and of course, Lamborghinis. Bitcoin’s nature as sound money means that the miners can’t simply increase output to meet increased demand, so I don’t predict we’ll see the end of volatility any time soon.</p>
<p>Whatever their reasons for learning about Bitcoin, each wave of adoption causes a small few to look past the promise of riches to start asking serious questions about the nature of money and the state. These conversations take years, but in the end, Bitcoin is showing people the way toward a sound money. And that could take us way beyond the Moon.</p>

This work is happening without their permission or knowledge.</p><p>Buying Bitcoin to make payments is going to be the number one use case on Earth. It’s going to be done with Pine wallet, Blue Wallet and Azteco as the means of getting Bitcoin. I’m not speculating by the way. Mr. Jabesi is 100% correct. He can see this thanks to his perspective.</p><p>Without exposure to different perspectives and the ability to empathise, it is not possible to understand why Bitcoin was written. If you think Bitcoin’s use case is solely a “store if value”, you are parochial, ignorant, mind blind and closed off from reality. You don’t matter.</p><p>Bitcoin Matters. Bitcoin Exists. Bitcoin doesn’t follow your instructions or fit into your thinking; it is a tool that obeys the person who writes on it. If you understand what it is, you can use it to solve problems. That’s all there is to it. What you believe doesn’t matter.</p><p>Your limited imagination isn’t the standard that Bitcoin or developers must adhere to. Your lack of imagination, exposure, experience and guts is entirely your problem. It is not the reality. Other people who are not like you and who live in reality are not constrained by you.</p><p>If you’ve constructed the correct model, written the software to give your ideas the power to act, and have market access, the world can change because you’re not a coward and understand risk, problem solving and entrepreneurialism. The weak and frightened can’t do this.</p><p>WhatsApp, Airbnb, Uber, Apple, Whisper Systems and others all exhibit the correct way of thinking. If you can’t muster the thinking for yourself, you can try to emulate…but nothing can cure your cowardice. You’ll never build something like Uber, invest in it or be associated.</p><p>Cowards just don’t have what it takes to change the world. A coward could never build Uber, and similarly the global Bitcoin Unicorn will not be built by or associated with cowards. These are matters of fact, not opinion. Facts don’t care about your feelings.</p><p>Nothing in the last 1000 years would have been built if men and women spent time describing problems as an end in itself. Definition is the first step only; it isn’t the goal. Solving problems and helping people is the goal. Bitcoin exists to solve a problem. Cowards ignore this.</p><p>Bitcoin was designed to replace fiat. It wasn’t designed to co exist with it. Many people simply can’t imagine that that goal can be achieved. That’s their problem; the problem of a lack of imagination. Bear in mind, none of these people thought fiat was a problem at all.</p><p>Do you really think that these imaginationless “recent converts” who want to constrain and pigeonhole Bitcoin can imagine the future? If you do, you’re a fool; these people can’t imagine anything, let alone what the near future will be like. On the other hand developers can.</p><p>Because entrepreneurs are aiming at a point in the future, they can see a future with their tool in it. The imaginationless can’t, because they don’t even know the tools are in development. Steve jobs knew that no phone in the future would have a keyboard. Normal people scoffed.</p>medium.com/media/7b3818cedc9caa3c6228adc3e4bef7ff/href<p>And YOU are not that stupid because you understand what Bitcoin is, are not a Virtue Signalling coward, and understand that the tools and services of “The Transformation” are being built right now. You don’t just talk about solving problems, you’re solving them by acting.</p><p>And let me be perfectly clear, and I’ve said this before. People whose role it is to act as educators are essential parts of the Transformation equation. In order for anything to happen people need to be persuaded that Bitcoin is a boon, and not a threat. medium.com/hackernoon/bit…</p><p>The Transformation needs gifted writers, thinkers and educators like @saifedean who is a perfect example of entrepreneurial spirit, and risk taking with his new education platform set to disrupt the global University system. Universities won’t like it like Banks hate Bitcoin.</p>♦

  <p>The system is rigged. We all can see it in the opulent residences of the rich in San Francisco which lie blocks away from the squalid tents of the homeless. We can feel it in the way that certain people and businesses do little to better civilization yet make ludicrous amounts of money. We can hear it in the frivolity with which certain people spend money and the morbid gravity of those whose souls are crushed by debt.</p>♦<p>That the system favors certain people and screws over others is obvious even to a five-year-old. Why the system is so unfair is not at all obvious and is the source of much political confusion. People on the left think the rich get there through exploiting the poor. People on the right think the poor get there because they’re lazy. What’s the truth? What’s going on and why is the system rigged?</p>Fiat Money is Unfair<p>At the root of the unfairness of the current system is money. This is not the first place people look, but it is where every sound analysis leads. The system is unfair because the money itself is unfair.</p>♦<p>To see how this is the case, let’s start with what we’ve been observing the past 4 months. Governments all around the world have spent with complete abandon. But where does that money come from? Who’s paying for all the stimuli and bailouts and grants? The amounts in these emergency measures to revive the economy in the past few months are absolutely staggering. They are well in excess of revenue these governments collect in taxes.</p><p>There are two possible answers. The money is coming from no one in particular and not paid for by anyone (something for nothing), or the cost is hidden and paid by people, just not obviously (something for something).</p>How Fiat Money Works<p>Is it really so simple? Can we help everyone who needs help just by printing more money without bad effects? Can we get something for nothing?</p>♦<p>If it really is that simple, this leaves us with the obvious question. If the government can just print money to pay for everything, why are we paying taxes at all? If the Fed/US government can spend $6 trillion to revive the economy and it doesn’t have any other effect, why not spend $60 trillion or $300 trillion (enough to make every person in the US a millionaire)?</p><p>The fact that this hasn’t been done (and just common sense) is evidence that we can’t get something for nothing. This is a convenient lie to give the people the illusion of getting government services without cost.</p><p>Despite what we may want to believe, we can’t get something for nothing. Such claims that legislators promote are the economic equivalent of perpetual motion machines: that is, impossible.</p><p>The spending is paid for via less purchasing power or what we call inflation. So why haven’t we seen that much inflation? Hasn’t the Consumer Price Index (CPI) been 2–3% for a long time now? For USD, at least, there’s something called the “exorbitant privilege” which is the result of a particular historical event, namely the result of WWII.</p>♦The Dollar Hegemony<p>The dollar privilege, or dollar hegemony, is propped up through its position in international trade. Oil, in particular, has to be bought with dollars, so every company and every country has to keep some reserve in dollars (or get loans in dollars) if it wants to buy oil. Because of the dollar’s usefulness in buying oil, international trade tends to be settled in the dollar as well. As a result, the dollar has far more liquidity than any other currency. So in a liquidity crisis like we have now, capital flows toward the dollar, meaning that there’s higher demand for USD.</p><p>The demand for the dollar offsets the dollar inflation or expansion. To be more precise, it’s actually the other way around. The Fed is expanding the supply of USD to offset the crazy dollar demand around the world. This, in turn, means that other currencies depreciate relative to the dollar. In other words, USD inflation gets exported. Though the US does produce many goods that get exported around the world, the exorbitant privilege is in being able to export the dollar. The trade deficit is essentially goods that enter the US for newly printed money.</p>♦<p>Monetary expansion (a.k.a. quantitative easing, credit facilities, loan programs, money printing) is an obscured tax. We cannot get something for nothing and $6 trillion in monetary expansion will have the effect of taking stored value from all owners of the money, which is an implicit tax. What’s more, since a lot of the dollar holders are not in the US, this effectively taxes people around the world who have no say at all in US government, let alone the Fed’s monetary policy! All those people, companies and countries that hold the dollar are getting taxed without representation.</p><p>The morality of monetary expansion is explained by a 14th century Bishop, Nicole Oresme:</p><blockquote>For every change of money…involves forgery and deceit, and cannot be the right of the prince, as has previously been shown. Therefore, from the moment when the prince unjustly usurps this essentially unjust privilege, it is impossible that he can justly take profit from it. Besides, the amount of the prince’s profit is necessarily that of the community’s loss. But whatever loss the prince inflicts on the community is injustice and the act of a tyrant and not of a king, as Aristotle says. And if he should tell the tyrants’ usual lie, that he applies that profit to the public advantage, he must not be believed, because he might as well take my coat and say he needed it for the public service.</blockquote><p>The euphemisms for fiat money printing are legion: “loans,” “debt,” “bond issue” or some other financial instrument that implies being paid back. This is to give the illusion that the value is being taken, not from the holders of the dollar, but from some specific entity that lent it the money and that the debt will be paid back in some way later. This is the ethical equivalent of seizing my coat and saying it’ll be given back later because the government has need of it. At the very least, I should be compensated for the fact that my coat is being used by the government.</p>♦<p>And indeed, there is compensation being paid by the government, but it doesn’t go to you or me, it goes to the Central Bank, or more precisely, the private and undisclosed shareholders of the member banks of the Federal Reserve in the form of interest. So in a way, someone else gets compensated to borrow your goods! Imagine if the government seized your car for 6 months and compensates some banker you’ve never met that doesn’t have anything to do with your car. That’s what’s happening when the Fed expands the money supply.</p><p>As Oresme says above, monetary expansion is an unjust seizure of wealth. The open and honest way for any government to pay for its services would be to explicitly tax the citizens. People generally don’t like taxes so will not consent without a really good reason. This is how governments were held accountable in hard money societies, as government couldn’t tax too much without a revolt.</p>♦<p>Yet the government can and does tax its citizens, just not explicitly or openly. Instead it does so covertly and implicitly through inflation. By this mechanism, it satisfies the right by having low explicit taxes and the left by providing lots of government services. Deficit spending/monetary expansion is a loophole that every government has exploited to tax its citizens for the last 50–100 years.</p>How Bitcoin Is Different<p>Bitcoin has two unique qualities which make it especially fair. First, it is near impossible to counterfeit. Anyone running a full node can check quite easily whether the bitcoins they received are genuine (spoiler: BCH is not bitcoin nor is BSV). That is, Bitcoin is easily recognizable and cannot be faked.</p><p>Second, it is impossible to inflate Bitcoin beyond the supply schedule created at its inception. The entire community of full node operators and bitcoin holders would have to agree to make that happen (spoiler: it won’t). That is, it’s a hard money with a hard cap.</p>♦<p>These are specifically the two properties that make implicit/covert taxation so difficult and incentivizes an open and honest government. No longer can the sovereign just print more money to fund its latest program, it would either have to save revenue from prior years, cut some other program or tax the populace to pay for it. The loophole of deficit spending, which is really just printing more money and imposing an implicit tax on all dollar holders, is closed and spending has to be aligned with revenue.</p><p>Oresme’s insight that money belongs to everyone that owns it reveals a fundamental truth: monetary expansion violates the property rights of everyone who holds the money. Bitcoin is the first money to enforce the ideal that the money belongs to everyone who holds it, and not some authority that claims it with threats of violence.</p><p>Bitcoin is the first money that makes the monetary abuse by authorities impossible. Bitcoin is impossible to inflate without consent from everyone. On a Bitcoin Standard, the path that governments have to take in order to raise revenue is to get explicit consent for taxes instead of implicit theft through inflation.</p>Conclusion<p>The monetary system that we’re under is a tyranny. The Fed is an independent organization and is not accountable to voters. Furthermore, the dollar standard means that inflation gets exported to people outside the US, who have even less say. The dollar hegemony is an unjust system where the wealth of the world is controlled by an organization that’s able to tax without anyone’s consent.</p><p>The rallying cry of 1776 was “no taxation without representation.” The entire world is being taxed by an organization in which only the very powerful and rich have representation. It’s time to end the Fed.</p>♦<p>This isn’t a new sentiment. Ron Paul wrote a book about it over a decade ago. But now, we can do something about it outside of our broken political system. We can buy bitcoin and declare monetary independence. Real justice means economic justice. Fairness means a system that isn’t rigged. Bitcoin propels meritocracies. Bitcoin expunges systemic unfairness.</p><p>The system is rigged. Bitcoin fixes this.</p>♦

  <p>♦</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a petition circulating around Caltech to remove Robert Millikan&#8217;s name and image from campus buildings and fixtures. Millikan won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his oil drop experiment and was the founding president of Caltech. But, it turns out he was also a proponent of eugenics, and that is Unacceptable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reminded of an incident a couple years ago, when one very woke Stanford student urged the university to rename Terman Library. You see, Lewis Terman was a eugenics supporter, and that kind of hate has no place on a diverse and inclusive campus like Stanford University.</p>
<p>That was all well received, until someone informed the kid that Terman was in fact named after Frederick Terman, the former Dean of Engineering and cofounder of Stanford Research Park. That&#8217;s why Terman is the name of the Engineering library and not the Race Science library. Lewis Terman, the eugenicist, was Frederick&#8217;s dad.</p>
<p>This mistake has happened multiple times.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also reminded of that time the Palo Alto school board decided to rename Terman Middle School (this time they got the right Terman). A board committee chose the name Yamamoto Middle School, in honor of Fred Yamamoto, a Japanese-American who was sent to FDR&#8217;s concentration camps during WWII. Staunchly loyal to the country (or inordinately optimistic), Yamamoto later enlisted in the Army and died in battle.</p>
<p>A hero and inspiration to us all. BUT &#8212; </p>
<p>The school board somehow overlooked the fact that Fred shares a surname with another famous Yamamoto &#8212; Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, who led the bombing of Pearl Harbor. </p>
<p>Parents complained, and the school board swapped in the name of a Holocaust survivor, Ellen Fletcher. Fletcher Middle School it is.</p>
<p>Maybe the lesson here is that building names are stupid. It&#8217;s not an honor to have a namesake if names change with the latest Radical Chic. And if names are so impermanent, it&#8217;s stupid to affix one to a building. Just put a Victim-of-the-Month placard on the front entrance, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re trying to do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised to see this kind of bullshit go down at Stanford, where they have multiple departments dedicated to Grievance Studies. But I always had higher expectations for Caltech. No athletic recruits, no diversity quotas, no humanities department. That&#8217;s what a real university should look like. </p>
<p>Many years ago, when Quora was still a thing, I answered a query: &#8220;Does Caltech have the hardest undergraduate experience in the world?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s all a matter of perspective: To a Caltech student, the Feynman Lectures might be a little bit hard. To a Stanford student, 8th grade algebra might be hard.</p>
Show More</p>
<p>Having volunteered on the Caltech admissions committee, I know that every single student admitted to the university has the background and capability to take on Caltech&#8217;s curriculum.</p>
<p>Hans pointed out that most of the undergraduates were 1st or 2nd in their high school class. This is true. Caltech&#8217;s student body is not diverse. Because of the uniformity of academic backgrounds, Caltech can optimize its course curriculum to a very specific and high-achieving demographic.</p>
<p>Why are there are no introductory classes? Caltech does not admit students who need introductory classes. Freshman Math starts with multivariable calculus. If you need a bit more handholding when it comes to partial differential equations, you go to MIT.</p>
<p>When comparing average course offerings between universities, Caltech might seem hard. In reality, Caltech puts highly-capable students on track to achieve the best of their potential.</p>
<p>Then there’s the other type of “hard” – not in terms of academic rigor, but in sheer number of hours. Yes, with 130+ units of core curriculum in the hard sciences, the course requirements are indeed hard work.</p>
<p>This is the part that usually causes students to become jaded. The long hours consumed by coursework leaves little time for socializing or exploration. Caltech has a relatively low graduation rate compared to other top-ranked universities. The students who end up leaving, generally do so because their priorities are no longer academic &#8212; not because the school was “too hard”.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard as in demanding, time-consuming, you-must-surrender-your-soul. You&#8217;re not left with spare bandwidth to notice microaggressions, and it doesn&#8217;t matter because Demoralization is a Feature, not a Bug &#8212; That overwhelming sense of inadequacy is exactly how you&#8217;re supposed to feel when contemplating the Poincaré conjecture! There&#8217;s an old Caltech webcomic called Crippling Depression, which basically sums up the nature of scientific research and life at Caltech. </p>
<p>We always thought it was the challenging coursework that crushed our egos, but hey maybe it was actually the racist building names. The students should demand reparations.</p>

  <p>I very much like the theories for the broad phases of transitions. There are also correctly identified issues with S2F.</p><p>However, the biggest assumption I can see here which causes this case to break down is that there is a &quot;limit&quot; on the electrical input for Bitcoin.</p><p>It has been assumed here that the S19 energy efficiency holds through time. But in reality, Bitcoin mining efficiency has increased exponentially. Bitcoin mining is more than 10,000X more efficient than it was 10 years ago today. And average electrical prices drop every year. These two together mean that mining can continue to grow, provided efficiency continues to improve in a manner similar to Moore&#39;s Law.</p><p>You can read more here:</p><p>medium.com/capriole/bitcoin-value-energy-equivalence-6d00d1baa34a</p>♦

  ♦Time is Bitcoin<p>Bitcoin is an amazing tool in many ways, and every one of its aspects is enough to drive its adoption across the world. There is one improvement however that’s often overlooked, and that’s how fast Bitcoin is compared to sending international bank transfers.</p><p>If you have money to send from A to B, you’ve got limited means at your disposal to get it done. Let’s say you’re in Finland and you want to send $20,000 to California. You don’t have many good options available to you, believe it or not, even in 2020.</p>♦<p>To move your money, you could try a bank transfer. That means filling out a long form and submitting it to your bank, who if staffed by incompetents, will start asking you for the ID Card of the recipient. I’m not making this up. Then, once the form is submitted, you have to wait days for the money to arrive.</p><p>You could try sending the $20,000 with a Credit Card, but your recipient has to receive that payment on the Credit Card rails. If they accept Credit Cards, that has it’s own risks and high costs, if your Credit Card account will even allow you a transfer that large.</p><p>Many American services to send and receive money are USA only, so your contact in Finland can’t use those because they won’t give him an account. Sending money from one first world country to another is surprisingly onerous, long winded, risky, invasive and time consuming.</p><p>There is one way that your Finnish friend can send you money however. It will get to its destination instantly, is guaranteed to arrive correctly, requires no bank form to fill out or a teller to inspect, trust and second guess your intention or record the identity of the recipient.</p><p>That one way is Bitcoin.</p><p>With Bitcoin, all you need is the recipient’s Bitcoin address and you can send any amount of money anywhere, at any time, without a third party facilitator. Not only that, but it arrives instantly, and your goods can be shipped the same day because the vendor knows they’ve been paid for.</p>♦<p>Imagine counting up all the bank transfers done per day, and assume that they take three days each to complete. That’s a lot of time, and if that time was saved by using Bitcoin, the efficiency gains would be worth a lot of money. Because, “Time is Money”.</p><p>This is similar to the savings made by email and the web replacing mail order by post. No one today would tolerate having to use a paper catalogue to order pet food, shoes or nuclear submarines, but that’s what some people believe should be the case with sending money from A to B. It’s crazy.</p>♦Image from the Johnson Smith Catalogue used by generations of Americans to buy normal and very odd things.<p>And don’t forget too, that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and payer fraud-free. Once a payment is made, it is guaranteed. There can be no “charge backs” or other surprises and annoyances that are a permanent part of the legacy rails. Bitcoin totally eliminates these problems completely.</p><p>This single aspect of Bitcoin should be enough to make it totally replace credit cards, for small purchases online to large international bank transfers. All that’s missing are consumer grade interfaces to render using Bitcoin as easy as using a Credit Card. These interfaces are being developed right now.</p><p>And the public will need a trivially easy way to buy Bitcoin, that they already understand and which takes no skill to use. That’s what “Azteco” is, the Bitcoin Voucher company. Billions of people around the world top up their mobile phones with paper vouchers, and that’s exactly how Azteco works.</p>♦In South Africa, “Spaza” stores sell mobile topup vouchers for different phone networks. These stores are everywhere, and will sell Azteco Vouchers.♦An example Azteco Voucher, printed in the wild.<p>An azteco Voucher can be printed anywhere that mobile phone topups are already sold. The vouchers are simple to use, and require no training.</p><p>Each voucher can be issued in only four clicks, and if your staff can issue a Lotto ticket or any sort of receipt, they can easily sell an Azteco Voucher.</p><p>With an Azteco Voucher, people who don’t have access to banking or online eCommerce suddenly have the power to pay.</p><p>Merchants across the world can accept payments of any size from anyone without the fear of charge-backs or fraud. Billions of people will be empowered by Azteco and Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin empowers people and brings them into the global eCommerce community as first class citizens. It is a tool of empowerment and equality.</p><p>On top of the time savings that will benefit westerners, Bitcoin will open many doors for an astonishing number of people.</p><p>Billions of people on Earth can’t access any sort of global money service, despite being able to make calls to any phone in the world. With Bitcoin it is now possible for them to participate in financial transactions globally. This is an important, entirely beneficial and significant empowerment.</p><p>The platform that enables this transformation is the humble and ubiquitous mobile phone, that has spread to every corner of the globe. The on-ramp that makes it possible is Azteco; the easiest way to get Bitcoin, tailored to the consumer who needs access to it’s world changing properties.</p><p>This is a big deal. The Consumer Bitcoin market will be worth billions of dollars. To say, “This is exciting” is the understatement of the decade.</p><p>Azteco is growing the number of its outlets. Follow us on Twitter for announcements as we roll out integrations and new vendors!</p>♦<p>Bitcoin as Time Saver was originally published in The Startup on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by Ross Ulbricht</p><p>A follow-up to this article is here.</p><p>I read the Maker Protocol white paper recently. What a cool concept! The people behind Maker have created a cryptocurrency that tracks the value of the US dollar (a stable coin). You get all the benefits of a cryptocurrency without the crazy price swings. Naturally, it has become very popular, and hundreds of millions of dollars worth have been minted.</p><p>I dug further into Maker’s documentation, and read some articles about its recent collateral crisis in March 2020. There is no way I can get a full understanding of the system and what happened from within prison, but taking what I have read at face value, I believe I can contribute some ideas that will help keep this kind of crisis from happening again.</p><p>The stable coin issued by the Maker protocol is called DAI. The value of DAI is backed by collateral held in virtual vaults on the Ethereum blockchain. Vault owners are the foundation of the whole system. The value in their vaults backs the value of all DAI in circulation. If the total value in the vaults ever falls below the dollar-pegged value of all the DAI, then the system is insolvent and can be considered a failure.</p><p>I think the problem with the Maker Protocol which led to its recent crisis is a misunderstanding of the role of vault owners. In several places, I have seen them referred to as “borrowers,” which did not make sense to me at first. What are they borrowing? And then it clicked: the idea is that vault owners are borrowing DAI from the Maker Protocol itself and putting up collateral (usually ether) in their vaults to back the loan. This is like taking a mortgage out on your house with the ether being the house and the DAI being a loan from a bank. Just like with the mortgage, vault owners have to pay interest on the money they have borrowed in what is called a “stability fee.” And if the value of their collateral drops too low, their vault can be auctioned off. This is like a house going into foreclosure. Here is why this analogy does not work: the DAI being “borrowed” has no value apart from the collateral that is backing it. Its value comes from the fact that, when push comes to shove, it can be redeemed for the collateral in a liquidation auction. The Maker Protocol has assumed the role of the bank, issuing loans backed by collateral, but it seems to me that the vaults themselves are the banks, at least how banks used to be.</p><p>Before the advent of modern central banking, banks used to hold gold in their vaults, then print and lend out paper currency backed by that gold. Vault owners in the Maker Protocol are doing something similar. They are holding ether in their vaults, then lending out DAI backed by that ether. So, they would be more appropriately thought of as lenders, not borrowers. Banks were supposed to keep enough gold in their vaults to cover all outstanding currency that the gold was backing. In practice, they printed more currency than they could back and just hoped everyone didn’t show up at once for their gold. When the inevitable bank runs did occur, bankers looked to their pals in government for a bailout. Nowadays, dollars are backed by nothing and fractional reserve banking is the norm. Banks still get into trouble and expect to be bailed out. It’s a bit of a mess, really.</p><p>This is not a good model for Maker to emulate. The protocol is not a modern bank because it doesn’t have the backup of the government. Instead, vault owners should be treated like good old-fashioned banks, except they can’t cheat because all of the accounting is done publicly on the blockchain. If they try to issue more DAI than their ether can support, they run the risk of being liquidated. The fundamental difference between this and the current way the Maker Protocol is designed is that, as lenders, vault owners should collect interest, not pay it.</p><p>When I read the white paper, my first question was “why on earth would anyone put their valuable ether in a vault to back other people’s stable coins (DAI) if they are going to be charged a fee? And on top of the stabilization fee, they also risk losing 13% of their collateral to a liquidation fee if the collateral’s value drops too low. So why take all this risk without a reward?” It turns out the system rewards other behavior (that should not be rewarded), and vault owners can take advantage of it.</p><p>The protocol has a smart contract users can lock their DAI in and receive a “savings rate” while it is there. “Ok,” I thought. “If the savings rate is higher than the stability fee, then vault owners can just mint DAI backed by the ether in their vaults, put it in the savings contract and — so long as they mind their liquidation ratio — get a return on their ether (savings rate minus stability fee).” But why would we want to incentivize this? The whole point of DAI is that it can circulate as a decentralized, blockchain-based stand in for US dollars, not be locked in a smart contract.</p><p>It turns out before the crisis in March, the savings rate was around 8% and the stability fee was around 0.5%. So my suspicions were correct: vault owners could get a return (7.5%), not by selling DAI into circulation and being good stewards of their vaults, but by keeping their minted DAI for themselves and parking it in the savings contract. Apparently, a huge fraction of all DAI in existence was in the savings contract before the crisis hit. (see Figure 1.)</p>♦Fig. 1<p>The purported purpose of the savings contract is so the committee overseeing the protocol (Maker DAO) can adjust the savings rate to draw DAI in and out of circulation in order to influence the price and keep it close to parity with the dollar. I really don’t think this is necessary. Market forces are what keep the price stable because there are arbitrage opportunities on both sides of parity that push the price back to equilibrium. The savings contract just feels like a tool a central banker would want so he can imagine he is “managing the economy.” This top-down impulse to control the price is not in harmony with the decentralized ethos of the protocol. Worse, it is incentivizing behavior that makes the system less, not more stable.</p><p>A fully decentralized protocol is “governed” by math and logic, leaving the human decision making to the end users. The reliance on a central committee to set important parameters within the system is a weakness, not a strength. That is not to say that the Maker Protocol could necessarily function without a governing committee. It is a complex system, and the fact it works at all is impressive. However, the committee must be seen for what it is: a stop-gap. It is not an efficient mechanism for discovering the best values for the system parameters it oversees.</p>Crisis<p>Around mid-March, the price of ether dropped suddenly by about 50%, and the price of DAI spiked by over 10% (a huge amount for something that is supposed to trade one-for-one with the dollar). Many vaults became under-collateralized as the value of their ether dropped and were forced to liquidate. That’s a risk vault owners take. It is their job to make sure ether is added to make up the shortfall or that their outstanding DAI balance is paid down. However, the crisis became so acute that some vaults were forced to liquidate at extreme discounts, losing nearly all (and in some cases all) their collateral.</p><p>The problem stemmed from the fact that the whole system is chronically under-collateralized. Not only are vaults owners penalized with a stability fee for collateralizing the system, but the DAI burden is constantly being added to by the savings rate. Then during the crisis, no one wanted to give up their stable, high-yield DAI for a crashing, negative-yield ether in the liquidation auctions.</p><p>In the end, DAI had to be backed by USDC, a stablecoin backed by cash in a bank (hardly a decentralized solution). If the Maker Protocol is to become truly decentralized and independent, it has to get the fundamental incentives right and reject the allure of top-down control.</p>A Modest Proposal<p>Obviously, I advocate abolishing the savings contract and stabilization fee, but to replace them with what? First of all, the savings contract need not be replaced. The value of DAI is its stability, not some arbitrary rate of return. With regard to the stability fee, it should be negative. That is to say, vault owners should be rewarded, not penalized for providing collateral. So, it shouldn’t be called a stability fee at all. It really should be called a savings rate because vault owners are saving their ether in a vault and earning a return on it for the service of backing DAI. But this could be confusing because that term has already been used. Instead, it could be called a “collateral rate” for the rate of return on collateral.</p><p>Whatever its name, it will draw collateral into the system rather than repelling it. Where, you may ask, will the DAI come from to pay this collateral rate? It should come from the DAI issued by the vaults providing collateral. It is the holders of DAI who are being provided a service (a decentralized stablecoin), so it is they who should pay. And how should this rate be determined? A simple fix to the current system would be for MakerDAO (who already sets the stability fee and savings rate) to reduce the savings rate to zero and the stability fee to some small negative number, perhaps -1%. This would have to be done such that DAI would simply disappear at a rate of 1% per year, leaving that much more collateral unencumbered than would be otherwise.</p><p>A better solution would be to set up a system whereby vault owners set their own rates and compete with each other for the interest from DAI holders, with the lowest rates winning. This would keep rates low generally, but when there is a serious collateral shortage, rates will automatically rise via market forces, encouraging more collateral to come in and discouraging DAI hoarding. This is exactly the opposite of what we saw during the crisis of mid-March.</p><p>With the incentives appropriately aligned, there should be a much deeper market for DAI with tighter bid/ask spreads. The reason for this is that, with a positive rate of return, vault owners will be wanting to get their newly-minted DAI out onto the market so that others will be holding the depreciating asset (the rates cancel out while they are holding their own DAI). Thus, there will be ample liquidity above parity.</p><p>Below parity, there is an arbitrage opportunity so long as DAI holders can redeem DAI for collateral. If the price is below parity, people can buy discounted DAI, redeem them for excess collateral at the oracle exchange rate from the issuing vault, and then sell the collateral on the market at full value. (The oracle exchange rate is how the Maker Protocol determines collateral value). Thus, there will be ample liquidity below parity.</p><p>These forces will stabilize the price and ensure full collateralization, especially in turbulent market conditions.</p>Technical Part<p>The mechanics of this market-based system for determining the collateral rate get a bit complicated. Just skip to the conclusion if you are not interested in the details.</p><p>As noted above, vaults should set their own rates, with low-rate vaults winning the competition. However, unless there is excess collateral in the system, there is no competition. If all collateral is backing DAI, vault owners can charge whatever they want, with redemption for collateral the only recourse left to DAI holders. We can solve this by allowing unencumbered collateral to collect the interest of another vault’s DAI if its collateral rate is lower than the other vault’s rate. Thus, without having to mint DAI and sell it on the market, a vault owner can collect interest just by charging a lower rate. This is great for keeping rates low, but now there is no incentive to actually issue and sell DAI, especially because the vaults that do risk liquidation.</p><p>A compromise must therefore be struck whereby excess collateral in a low-interest vault can capture only a fraction of the issuing vault’s interest, with the rest going to the issuing vault, but at the low-interest vault’s rate. Thus, with excess collateral in the system, there will be a natural cutoff rate above which vaults that have issued DAI are losing interest to vaults with excess collateral below the cutoff, with both earning at the lower rate.</p><p>Which vaults capture from which? The vaults above the cutoff with the lowest rates should be captured from by the vaults with the highest rates below the cutoff. This will incentivize high-rate vaults to keep their rates low.</p><p>What fraction of the issuing vault’s interest should be captured by excess collateral below the cutoff? This should vary based on how much excess collateral is in the system compared to how much total DAI there is outstanding. If all DAI is paying interest to excess collateral (i.e, vaults with only excess collateral are below the cutoff), the capture rate should be 0%. The system is awash in excess collateral. The rate should increase linearly, reaching 100% when there is no excess collateral in the vaults below the cutoff: the system is near insolvency and needs excess collateral fast.</p><p>All of this handles the incentives keeping excess collateral in the system and collateral rates low, but the reason we want excess capacity is so we can use it when needed. To do that, there needs to be a mechanism whereby DAI are automatically switched from vaults close to insolvency to ones with excess collateral. This could be done through liquidation auctions the usual way. Vaults would mint DAI with their excess collateral and use it to bid. However, it would be good if this were done automatically to speed things up in a crisis, with the assets and liabilities (collateral and DAI) simply transferred to the well-capitalized vaults. Vaults could mark a portion of their excess collateral for this purpose and set a fee, with vaults liquidating to the low-fee vaults first.</p><p>The collateral rates set by the various vaults in the system will tend to converge on a single “market rate,” which is just the cutoff rate. Vaults below the cutoff are “leaving money on the table” because — so long as they don’t go above the cutoff — they can charge more without losing to a cheaper vault. One the other hand, vaults above the cutoff will be losing out to vaults below it with excess collateral.</p><p>When collateral (or the value of collateral in the case of an exchange rate change) drops, the cutoff will automatically rise because there will be less excess collateral below the cutoff, leaving higher-rate vaults to collect their full interest. The capture rate will also increase because a smaller fraction of DAI is paying interest to excess collateral. Both of these things will encourage new vaults and new collateral to flow into the system, alleviating the shortage, all without intervention from MakerDAO.</p><p>I tried to think of a way that the capture rate too could be decentralized and governed by market forces rather than by the linear formula above, but could not. The problem is that vaults are already competing based on their collateral rate for the benefit of DAI holders, so how could they also compete based on the capture rate for the benefit of vaults issuing DAI at the same time? One could devise a two-parameter formula that weighs these two values, leading to a single case, with interest going to the vaults with the lowest score, but this seems very complicated and rife with hidden loopholes. One could also leave the collateral rate and capture rate up to the vaults and direct interest to the vaults with the lowest total income, but then vaults could use extreme setti ngs, favoring DAI holders with very low collateral rates, but capturing 100% of the interest, for example.</p>Conclusion<p>The Maker Protocol is a very cool concept, and I hope it succeeds, but I fear it will meet with the kind of crisis we saw in mid-March 2020 again if these fundamental issues are not addressed. The next crash could result in systemic insolvency and catastrophic failure. There is a lot of money and even more potential riding on this. The crisis should be a wake-up call that reform is needed or new protocols need to be tried. I just hope the ideas above can help point that reform in the right direction.</p>♦

  1. The Triumvirate of Liquidity♦Introduction<p>US Treasuries, gold, and Bitcoin serve as a triumvirate of global liquidity, a powerful trio of safe haven assets that shelter their owners from the risks of our highly leveraged, credit-based monetary system. Of the $300+ trillion in financial assets around the world, only $32 trillion exist at this echelon of safety and liquidity.</p><p>Bitcoin captured an astonishing 1% of the trio’s total market value after only eight years in existence, yet this was only a glimpse of the future. In its next chapter, Bitcoin will catapult toward gold’s $9 trillion size, fulfilling its destiny as digital gold. After that, Bitcoin will morph into digital Treasuries and replace them as the world’s risk-free asset before eventually achieving world reserve currency status. Replacing the dollar as the world reserve currency is a lofty ambition, but it will occur only as a byproduct of Bitcoin embodying digital Treasuries.</p>Gold was the dollar’s source of legitimacy<p>Gold is the original liquid global asset, a millennia-old money. The US dollar’s gold-backing during the 20th century earned it legitimacy, culminating in the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement in which the world’s leaders assigned the dollar as the world reserve currency. Even though gold no longer officially anchors global finance, central banks still hoard it as the world’s safe haven asset, presumably as insurance against a dollar system failure. Today, global central bank gold holdings exceed $1 trillion.</p>♦Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, 1944Dollars, meet Eurodollars<p>In the 1950s, a new form of dollar emerged in Europe called the Eurodollar, a book-entry dollar to facilitate interbank settlement outside of the United States and outside the Federal Reserve banking system. As Eurodollar usage popularized, banks in London, Zurich, Montreal, and Tokyo gained the power to create the international settlement currency away from any regulatory purview. By 1971, excessive dollar redemptions for gold had depleted the United States’ reserves. In order to protect its holdings of the world’s safe haven asset, the US ceased all dollar-to-gold conversions, and the dollar officially lost backing. It still, however, had the confidence of global financial participants as their ultimate unit of account.</p>Treasuries, not dollars<p>Dollars weren’t backed by risk-free assets anymore, so how did investors store dollar reserves safely? Bank deposits are essentially loans to banks and come with an inordinate amount of counterparty risk. Withdrawing truckloads of $100 bills isn’t feasible either, nor does it come with convertibility to an underlying asset. Deposits and cash simply aren’t palatable investments for the risk-averse. The solution and capital market tendency is to purchase US Treasuries, a $23 trillion market, in order to safely store dollars.</p>The dollar loses its identity<p>From 1971 to 2007, banks took complete control of the dollar, obfuscated its identity, and built an inherently unstable financial system on top of it. Eurodollars grew both in supply and sophistication. Banks stopped funding themselves with deposits; instead, they used US Treasuries as collateral to borrow book-entry dollars from each other. A bank license and US Treasuries together wielded the power to create seemingly unlimited money, obscuring money’s very definition. The dollar lost all of the identity it once had as a gold claim and became purely a banking liability, a loan to the overly-leveraged financial system. Instead of dollars, Treasuries became the most desirable global asset, not only because of the US government’s counterparty superiority, but also because Treasuries possessed omnipotent collateral powers that enabled money creation. Banks use US Treasuries, not dollars, as their risk-free asset, collateral anchor, and primary leverage vehicle.</p>The dollar system breaks in 2007<p>In 2007, banks began facing funding pressure. The previous culture of strike-of-the-pen collateralized lending withered away, and banks were unable to roll forward their maturing debt. Banks relied on their ability to constantly issue new debt, and when confidence in them faltered, so did solvency.</p><p>For decades, the relationship between dollars and Eurodollars existed without much drama; Federal Funds and LIBOR, the interest rate of each dollar type, mostly mirrored each other. In August 2007, however, LIBOR drifted higher relative to the Federal Funds rate, a sign of acute credit risk in the Eurodollar system. In hindsight, the problem wasn’t acute: banks began pulling back from each other as the global dollar system had reached an inflection point. This interest rate divergence foreshadowed the subsequent cascade of dollar-funding shortfalls and bank collapses. The multi-decade free run of money creation had cracked irrevocably.</p><p>In 2008, the Federal Reserve bailed out the world by liquifying the entire system. It chose not to discriminate between dollar liabilities and Eurodollar liabilities, and provided a lifeline to any bank or central bank in need by injecting reserves onshore and providing currency swaps offshore. Demand for the safety and liquidity of US Treasuries skyrocketed as they became the world’s security blanket, trapping the world in a dollar denomination even though the dollar’s long term viability as world reserve currency was irrefutably in question.</p>Permanent disrepair<p>The financial system is infected with a chronic disease that won’t go away. The dollar is no longer solely the national currency for the United States issued by the Federal Reserve. Instead, the dollar is an international banking instrument without limits, form, or the ability to sustain itself. The system decays as contractions in interbank liabilities cause repeated liquidity shortages for leveraged asset holders. Banks choose not to provide collateralized liquidity to other banks, even when the collateral is Treasuries themselves. This is the ultimate warning sign that banks don’t trust each other anymore. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve always bails out the system as the lender of last resort, permanently eliminating any motivation whatsoever for banks to provide liquidity to each other. The Fed’s default response is to create US dollar bank reserves, but this does not address the core problem of broken interbank trust. The Fed only provides a numbing mechanism, keeping the dying patient alive as long as they can.</p>Bitcoin is digital gold and digital Treasuries<p>What’s the endgame? Bitcoin is. Its software is engraved with “Chancellor on the Brink of Second Bailout” to proclaim an elegant solution to our banking system nightmare. Bitcoin is a bearer asset like gold, a risk-free asset like Treasuries, and a currency denomination like the dollar, rising up in parallel over the next couple decades as the infrastructure for the next financial system.</p>♦The original newspaper article referenced in Bitcoin’s genesis block<p>Gold and Bitcoin are both scarce assets without counterparty risk, yet Bitcoin’s digital final settlement functionality gives it a massive advantage over gold in the coming decades. Bitcoin is not only digital gold though, it’s also digital Treasuries. Bitcoin is the safe haven from all other digital assets, just as Treasuries are the safe haven from all other dollar assets. Bitcoin is used as collateral for derivatives agreements just like Treasuries are. But Bitcoin doesn’t have the counterparty risk or supply variability of Treasuries, positioning it perfectly for the forthcoming competition.</p><p>Bitcoin is the risk-free asset of the future.</p>The anti-Bretton Woods<p>The Bretton Woods monetary system established the dollar as the world’s reserve currency in 1944, but the next monetary system will not be determined by agreement between nations. Bitcoin’s path to world reserve currency status will occur one asset holder at a time. Thanks to the early-stage Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s design now includes an instantly settling currency function in addition to its slower asset function, a characteristic neither Treasuries nor gold possess. But Bitcoin first needs to add many trillions in market value to truly compete with Treasuries and gold as an asset class.</p>Uncertainty demands liquidity<p>Investors demand risk-free assets when they face geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Securing the liquidity of these assets is paramount when other asset classes experience the brutal combination of increased performance risk and liquidity deterioration that is so common in today’s financial world. In this era of dollar system fragility, the Triumvirate of Liquidity will reign supreme. Investors will scramble for financial safety, causing intense and persistent demand for US Treasuries, gold, and Bitcoin.</p>2. The Rise of Bitcoin: A Source of Yield<p>This is not financial advice. Please note, these examples are purely theoretical in nature, and this article is not an endorsement or recommendation of these strategies. Do your own research.</p><p>Eleven years and more than six hundred thousand blocks ago… Satoshi bestowed upon us a financial revolution unlike anything in the history of humankind. Few realized it at the time, but now, with each passing block, Bitcoin gets stronger, and more and more naysayers become Bitcoiners.</p><p>Scholars will look back on this era and fill pages upon pages with their thoughts and analyses, but they will not characterize this time as “The Death of Fiat.” Rather, they will hail it as the “Rise of Bitcoin.”</p>♦<p>We are, without a doubt, amidst a mass conversion to a world denominated in Bitcoin. Take these religious overtones with a grain of salt, but investors are becoming increasingly focused on Bitcoin-denominated gains, foregoing the antiquated mental model obsessed only with how much Bitcoin’s price can appreciate versus the dollar. In fact, many American Bitcoiners transitioned away from their mental dollar denomination in part because of their displeasure with the current “religion” of the Federal Reserve, issuer of USD.</p><p>We have entered the era of dual-denominated approach to portfolio management, in which investors measure profits and losses in both BTC and USD terms.</p><p>In Tantra Labs’ BTC Denominated Portfolio Management &amp; the Structure of Bitcoin Interest Rates, we identified several ways to generate a Bitcoin-denominated yield by using Bitcoin as collateral: exchange lending, depository instruments, Lightning Network routing, and as collateral for derivatives trading.</p><p>In this piece, we will take an inside look at one specific derivatives strategy — selling covered calls — and how that strategy is front and center in the exploration of dual-denominated portfolio management.</p>Call Options<p>A call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset, in this case Bitcoin, at a specified price within a specific time period. Here’s an example, from a USD perspective (spot price of BTC as of this writing is ~$8,000, options data is from Deribit): a call option to buy 1 BTC at a $20,000 strike price expires on September 25th, 2020. The price of this call option is $480. That means the buyer pays a “premium” of $480 for the right to buy 1 BTC at $20,000 on 9/25/2020. If Bitcoin’s price rises to $25,000, the owner of the call can “exercise” the option, pay $20,000 for 1 BTC, sell it for $25,000, and realize a $5,000 profit. Or, the investor could just keep 1 BTC. The seller of the option sells 1 BTC for $20,000 (instead of at the market price) and collects $480 in premium. As we begin to see, profits and losses are happening simultaneously in two denominations, BTC and USD.</p><p>Which denomination should investors target for returns? It depends, and each investor will prioritize gains and losses differently for each denomination.</p>The BTC perspective<p>Let us now think about these trades from a BTC perspective. Deribit, a cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform, only allows BTC as collateral, not USD. Example: a call option to buy 1 BTC at a $20,000 strike price expires on September 25th, 2020. The price of this call option is 0.057 BTC. If Bitcoin’s price rises to $25,000, the owner of the call can exercise the option, and take delivery of 1 BTC for only $20,000. The seller of the option is forced to sell that 1 BTC for $20,000 instead of the market price of $25,000, and retains the 0.057 BTC original premium collected.</p>The Dual perspective<p>We can make some assumptions about the buyer of these call options. He or she is essentially looking for a cheaper way to acquire Bitcoin versus buying at market price. Now, take the perspective of our covered call seller, Alice, as she thinks about her strategy in both denominations. She owns 5 BTC, and decides to post 1 BTC as collateral to Deribit. She can now sell a “covered” call, which means she actually owns the 1 BTC she would have to deliver in case the contract is exercised.</p><p>In other words, she is not taking any leverage. She collects a premium of 0.057 BTC and keeps the 1 BTC posted as collateral as long as the price doesn’t rise above $20,000. Her worst-case scenario, selling 1 BTC for $20,000 if the price is above that amount, is an acceptable risk to her, partly because her remaining BTC holdings will show phenomenal USD-denominated gains in that scenario. She is taking a dual-denominated approach to portfolio management because her worst case scenario in BTC terms is actually a very profitable scenario when expressed in USD-denominated terms. If Bitcoin’s price doesn’t explode, she gets to keep the premium and her original 1 BTC that was posted as collateral.</p>A Source of Bitcoin Yield<p>Collecting options premiums by selling covered calls is a form of Bitcoin income. This strategy alters the overall Bitcoin-denominated return profile for a Bitcoin holder. Alice reduces her exposure to parabolic upward price movements, but she trades that exposure for a stream of income in the form of BTC-denominated options premium. The yield, in this example, would be over 7% annualized, earned in BTC.</p><p>Large equity holders regularly employ such a strategy: if an investor owns several million shares of a leading technology company, selling covered calls against those shares gives the investor a nice income boost from options premium, foregoing any upside beyond the option’s strike price. The investor is comfortable with such a strategy because he or she doesn’t mind sacrificing some of his or her ownership of the company, especially if that means the rest of his or her holdings are experiencing impressive price appreciation.</p><p>The covered call seller is similar to an insurance provider. Insurance providers collect thousands of smaller premiums but are exposed to large events that trigger insurance payouts. Options markets can be thought of in a similar way: covered call premiums might be collected along the way, but if the price of Bitcoin explodes, the seller will have to payout in the form of relinquishing Bitcoin for a discounted price when buyers exercise their call options.</p>Bitcoin is Productive Collateral<p>Bitcoin has been deemed a commodity by the CFTC and property by the IRS, but as the financial ecosystem around it evolves, Bitcoin is starting to resemble multiple asset classes at the same time.</p><p>In this case, Bitcoin’s options markets resemble features of the equity options market, especially from the perspective of dual-denomination. Large shareholders think both in terms of USD profit/loss and in terms of total percentage ownership of companies. Their strategies in options markets mirror what a large Bitcoin holder might consider to generate income from the asset they hold.</p><p>This strategy is ideal for sideways markets and also a decent way to compliment USD-denominated losses if the price of Bitcoin declines. It is a way to turn the hype cycle of Bitcoin, specifically the thirst for exposure to parabolic rises (of which we’ve had several in Bitcoin’s short 11 year history) into cash.</p><p>The demand for such exposure, is strong in the market, evidenced by record Bitcoin options volume. Holders of Bitcoin can consider risking some of their Bitcoin in order to monetize that demand, and use their Bitcoin collateral in order to generate more Bitcoin by selling call options and collecting BTC-denominated premium.</p>3. BTC Denominated Portfolio Management &amp; the Structure of Bitcoin Interest Rates<p>Since Google’s IPO in 2004, its stock is up over 2,000% while the S&amp;P 500 is up less than 200%. This type of relative outperformance is nothing new to bitcoin investors, many of whom have seen astronomical returns no matter what performance benchmark is used, as long as that benchmark is in dollars. But what happens if your home denomination isn’t US dollars? In this research piece, we examine what happens when investors start to think about bitcoin in relation to itself rather than in relation to dollars.</p><p>The stock market index is a century old invention by the financial press in order to track a basket of companies with one value. Benchmark indices became ubiquitous because every corporate executive and portfolio manager wanted to measure performance versus their competition. But the benchmark for Bitcoin fund managers shouldn’t be anything USD related like the S&amp;P 500, Russell 2000, or Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index. The benchmark is now BTC.</p>What’s your denomination?<p>Investing in Bitcoin will always have fluctuating performance when converted back to USD, but what about for an investor who has switched his or her home denomination to BTC? While you might not see Wells Fargo offering a toggle feature for viewing USD deposits in a BTC denomination today, the prospect of entirely BTC denominated investors is now a reality.</p>♦♦Alice’s portfolio after her first bitcoin purchase<p>Here’s an example: Alice is an early investor in Bitcoin. She buys 500 bitcoin for $50,000 in 2013. As the price reached an uncomfortable level for her in late 2017, she decided to liquidate half her position, 250 BTC, at a price of $12,000 for a capital gain of nearly $3 million. She uses the $3 million to pay off debts and taxes, and sets up a steady income stream using a USD bond portfolio. She is now free from any dollar debt, has dollar inflows to cover monthly expenses, and also still has 250 BTC. Should she be thinking of her remaining bitcoin wealth in dollar terms? No. Her USD balance sheet is now stable, so she can start to think about a portion of her overall portfolio in bitcoin denomination.</p>♦♦Source of Alice’s USD income streamBTC is a home denomination for a growing population<p>At Tantra Labs, we argue that Alice should be looking at her bitcoin holdings as a standalone investment portfolio granted her USD balance sheet is completely sound. Alice has already diversified away from her bitcoin wealth by setting up a USD fixed income portfolio. Her next step should be to diversify her bitcoin portfolio by altering her current allocation of 100% cold storage.</p><p>Remove yourself from the shackles of a USD denominated world, for Alice’s sake. How can Alice maximize her BTC denominated wealth? Can she balance security and risk appropriately? With her USD portfolio properly allocated, Alice is ready to turn her attention to her Bitcoin wealth. She should use some principles from traditional portfolio management, but many of them don’t apply to Bitcoin. Tantra Labs introduces a new framework for BTC denominated portfolio management and the overall structure of bitcoin interest rates.</p>The structure of bitcoin interest rates<p>We have identified five main types of Bitcoin portfolio allocations currently available in the BTC denominated investment universe. Each sleeve has Bitcoin-native attributes and characteristics completely unique to this new cryptography-based asset class. We will make analogies to traditional investing with the caveat that not all analogies are complete or sufficient to describe Bitcoin.</p><p>The first Bitcoin allocation type is bitcoin held in cold storage. This investment is holding bitcoin without any counterparty risk and likely with a marginally negative return when factoring hardware and software wallet solutions, multisignature key signing services, and storage and redundancy costs.</p><p>The second and third Bitcoin allocation types carry varying levels of counterparty risk: exchange lending and depository instruments. Exchange lending of bitcoin is very similar to the concept of securities lending of bonds and equities to facilitate short selling. Bitcoin deposits work similarly to bank deposits; Bitcoin banks will profit by capturing a spread between borrowers and lenders. The interest rate in each transaction represents a combination of the time value of bitcoin and any risk premiums associated with the borrowing party, whether bitcoin exchange or bitcoin bank.</p><p>The fourth Bitcoin allocation type is bitcoin allocated to payment channels in the Lightning Network, a high-velocity routed network of Bitcoin nodes. Currently, nominal returns from routing fees still are outweighed by bandwidth and electricity costs because Lightning Network is in a nascent stage. Importantly, however, counterparty risk does not exist for the individual Lightning Network node operator; payment channels in Lightning Network use Bitcoin’s blockchain as its security anchor. The ability to earn bitcoin without taking explicit counterparty default risk is truly novel in monetary history.</p>♦<p>The fifth Bitcoin allocation type is represented by Tantra Labs and its BTC denominated debt instruments. Returns are achieved by using algorithmic trading strategies with an explicit bitcoin benchmark. The objective is to outperform bitcoin held in cold storage. While cold storage bitcoin will have dollar returns dependent on bitcoin’s USD price performance, its bitcoin returns will essentially be zero. Tantra Labs is trading to outperform bitcoin itself, giving the investor access to an entirely new way of earning bitcoin.</p><p>Other BTC denominated return opportunities are coming online, all with their own idiosyncratic and counterparty risk. Derebit and LedgerX, online exchanges, allow writing options and collecting premium directly in bitcoin. Time value, risk premium, and volatility can all be theoretically determined from observing these transactions. A fund by Wave Financial started to capture this option premium and turn it into an income stream for investors.</p><p>Within bitcoin portfolio management, opportunities currently have varying degrees of liquidity, preventing a true comparison of interest rates right now. Lending bitcoin on BitMEX, for example, is a much higher capacity avenue to invest bitcoin versus payment channel routing in the Lightning Network.</p>Cold storage<p>Management of a bitcoin portfolio demands a first principles approach because the underlying money does not conform to what is currently considered money: central bank liabilities. Bitcoin is more comparable to gold or land than dollar deposits, as dollar deposits are liabilities on banks’ balance sheets. Bitcoin is a bearer asset much like a physical gold coin — once final delivery occurs, counterparty risk is eliminated.</p><p>This distinguishing characteristic between dollars and bitcoin alone should mandate an entirely different portfolio management approach, particularly in what the investor considers as the risk-free sleeve. Dollar investors buy US Treasury securities as the risk-free asset due to its dramatically reduced risk in relation to dollar deposits at individual financial institutions. Reserve assets are not held in dollar deposit form, they are held in government securities.</p><p>On the other hand, bitcoin held by investors using a variety of cold storage methods does not need a US Treasury equivalent as a risk-free security. The holder of bitcoin using his or her own cold storage does not have a counterparty like a dollar deposit has, and therefore the bitcoin holder does not demand a liquid asset equivalent to US Treasuries. Bitcoin’s underlying nature as an asset eliminates the need for the asset/liability security/deposit tradeoff existing in traditional portfolio management. The bitcoin asset itself has deep liquidity and fungibility. Holding BTC is logistically superior to the USD process of earning dollars, depositing them at a bank, and purchasing US Treasuries to negate any counterparty risk to that bank.</p>Exchange lending<p>Exchange lending was the first example of bitcoin exhibiting time value. Exchanges wanted to allow customers to go short bitcoin. Mechanically, shorting bitcoin requires borrowing bitcoin at an interest rate and then selling it. Customers with bitcoin deposits accrued interest on their holdings by lending to short sellers.</p><p>Bitcoin exchange lending works in a similar way to securities lending in traditional capital markets. Investors with custody of securities can lend them to short sellers. Bitcoin exchange lending transactions carry an interest rate comprised of some combination of bitcoin’s time value and the default probability associated with the borrower and exchange.</p><p>BitMEX, for example, offers lending rates across multiple timeframes; rates fluctuate depending on market conditions. Earning interest by lending to short sellers is currently the most relevant example of bitcoin interest rates because exchanges like BitMEX see billions of dollars worth of daily volume. We’re able to see bitcoin’s collateral-like traits most clearly in this setting.</p>Deposit rates<p>Companies such as Unchained Capital, BlockFi, and Celsius offer deposit rates on bitcoin in order to capture a spread on lending activity. The source of interest is similar to exchange lending: the depositor is being compensated for the time value of bitcoin and any counterparty risk associated with the borrower.</p><p>BlockFi offers insured deposits at attractive rates, but the most interesting aspect of its current rates offerings is the stark difference between interest offered on small versus large deposits. On large balances of bitcoin, deposit rates are materially lower than on small balances. Tiered rates are an indication of insufficient market depth.</p><p>Insured deposits also carry denomination risk. If bitcoin are lost or stolen from an insured fund, the depositor should be aware that insurance payouts might occur in dollars instead of bitcoin. Payouts can also occur with some delay, leaving the depositor exposed to price movements if payouts aren’t denominated in bitcoin.</p>♦A sample BTC portfolioLightning Network routing<p>In 2017, the Bitcoin protocol’s Segregated Witness upgrade allowed Lightning Network to become a reality, forever affecting the way we think about settlement of money. Anybody with bitcoin could now join a peer-to-peer network and settle transactions instantly, without having to wait for block confirmations. Bitcoin simultaneously demonstrated two powerful traits as money when Lightning Network adoption began: velocity and native time value. A most welcome byproduct was a new way to allocate bitcoin: productive Lightning Network payment channels.</p><p>Investors should take note of Lightning Network not just for its unprecedented settlement characteristics but also for its Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs). Lightning Network contracts can be compared to zero-coupon fixed income instruments, making Lightning Network essentially a web of financial agreements all with embedded time value. In order to use Lightning Network, users pay for the right to use others’ channel capacity; the fees incurred by users are fees earned by network routers. Time value can be calculated from three observable metrics: channel capacity representing principal, routing fees earned representing income, and the measurement period representing time.</p><p>In a previous work, I introduced the idea of a Lightning Network Reference Rate (LNRR), an average of interest rates that Lightning node operators earn from providing liquidity to the network. Large node operators such as BitMEX Research have already published realized interest rates for their routing activity. We don’t know their exact calculation metrics, nor are we able to audit them, but the fact they are disclosing an interest rate is a promising sign that LNRR might become a reality one day. With LNRR, Bitcoin will have a native time-value component free from centralized decision makers, such as LIBOR panels or central banking monetary policy committees.</p><p>Lightning Network routing is not yet a profitable endeavor. Fees in Lightning Network are extremely low, and the size of the network isn’t big enough to offer a material return to even the largest capacity node operators. The fact that routing has a positive nominal return, however, is monumental for Bitcoin’s capital market because LNRR can theoretically function as Bitcoin’s reference rate. A reference rate should be free of counterparty risk so that borrowers can offer lenders a risk premium instead of an absolute value. Lenders use risk premiums to determine the quality of investment, and on goes the debt capital market. LNRR offers Bitcoin an opportunity to take the traditional debt capital market’s first principle, the structure of interest rates, and make it its own.</p>Tantra Labs<p>Tantra Labs has created a brand new type of BTC denominated instrument, one which sources return from the volatility of bitcoin’s price. The instrument is structured as a debt vehicle paying quarterly interest, with an additional performance-tied dividend.</p><p>Tantra Labs uses algorithmic trading strategies programmed to capitalize on one of Bitcoin’s inherent characteristics, price volatility. We’re of the few, but not alone; Wave Financial recently launched a fund with a bitcoin option writing strategy designed to accrue BTC yield to investors.</p><p>Bitcoin price volatility is a robust source of income for arbitrage, market making, and speculative strategies, and it shouldn’t be expected to decline until adoption has increased materially. If Bitcoin follows an internet-like adoption path, it will become the worldwide standard for value transfer online, its terminal market value is magnitudes higher than today’s; adoption waves will lead to massive price swings as more investors and savers coalesce around Bitcoin’s terminal value.</p><p>Tantra Labs’ mission is to deliver BTC denominated investors more bitcoin by taking advantage of that unpredictably volatile path forward. Additional performance-tied BTC payouts will help provide optionality to the current yield landscape and attract capital looking to invest in instruments with proper risk compensation.</p>Portfolio management♦<p>Bitcoin investors should be keeping the majority of holdings in some form of cold storage. Custodians are starting to offer robust solutions, and some with enough multi-signature features to mitigate any counterparty risk. Whatever the storage method, the age-old adage of Bitcoin should be held paramount: “not your keys, not your coins.” Bitcoin flourishes because of the paradigm shift it created in securing wealth and protecting it from confiscation. No matter how much financialization of Bitcoin takes place, people will always hold their own keys to ensure their financial sovereignty.</p><p>Bitcoin denominated investors now have many options to invest in order to earn more bitcoin and should consider part of their portfolio to be allocated away from cold storage. Exchange lending of bitcoin is definitely the deepest market; returns can be made on very large balances. Depository institutions are growing in popularity, but tiered rates are a sign that the market for deposits is immature. Lightning Network routing is fascinating, exciting, and the source of swells of Bitcoin enthusiasm, but the rates are extremely low and the liquidity is relatively non-existent today.</p><p>Tantra Labs and its new BTC denominated debt instruments have a unique opportunity to find a home with the bitcoin-benchmarked investor. Opportunities to use bitcoin to make more bitcoin are growing by the day, creating a bitcoin structure of interest rates complete with term structure and credit spreads. Any investment that requires signing a transaction, sending bitcoin, and receiving a BTC denominated return needs to be thought of in its own category, and soon we’ll have a robust BTC denominated interest rate market.</p>♦
